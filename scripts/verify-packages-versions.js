[INCORRECT PACKAGE VERSION]: Expected TypeScript v${TYPESCRIPT_VERSION}, got v${pkg.devDependencies.typescript}

Starting version 3.9, TypeScript emits module exports using \`Object.defineProperty\`,
with \`configurable: false\`, instead of \`exports.thing = module.thing;\` as it always used to do.
This means, that any object mutation after the initial compilation are impossible and makes
the package slightly less open for modifications, and prevent users from experimenting with it,
and from implementing some of their scenarios.

If you REALLY know what you are doing, and you REALLY want to use a different version of TypeScript,
modify \`TYPESCRIPT_VERSION\` constant at the top of this file (\`scripts/verify-packages-versions.js\`).
