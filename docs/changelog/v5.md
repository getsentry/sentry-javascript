_If you are a `@sentry/apm` and did manual instrumentation using `hub.startSpan` please be aware of the changes we did
to the API. The recommended entry point for manual instrumentation now is `Sentry.startTransaction` and creating child
Span by calling `startChild` on it. We have internal workarounds in place so the old code should still work but will be
removed in the future. If you are only using the `Tracing` integration there is no need for action._

in their own package called `@sentry/integrations`. For a detailed guide how to upgrade from `4.x` to `5.x` refer to our
[migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/MIGRATION.md).
