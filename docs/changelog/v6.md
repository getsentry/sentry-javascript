# Changelog for Sentry SDK 6.x

Sentry SDK v6 is no longer supported. We recommend migrating to the latest version of the SDK. You can start by
migrating from `v6` of the SDK to `v7` by following the [migration guide](../migration/v6-to-v7.md).

## 6.19.7

## 6.19.1

This release fixes a bug from 6.19.0 causing type import errors in most JS SDKs.

- fix(types): Point to type definitions in dist folder (#4745)

## 6.19.0

This release makes a change to the data normalization process, limiting the number of entries or properties which will
be included in any given array or object to 1000. Previously there was no limit, so in rare cases you may notice a
change in your context data. If this is a problem, you can increase the limit with the new `maxNormalizationBreadth`
setting. See [#4689](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/4689) for details.

## 6.18.2

If you are using `@sentry-internal/eslint-config-sdk`, please note that this release turns on the
[quotes rule](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/quotes) to enforce usage of single quotes.

This release also removes `@sentry/tracing` as a dependency of `@sentry/node`. Please explicitly install and import
`@sentry/tracing` if you want to use performance monitoring capabilities. For more details,
[see our docs on setting up Node Performance Monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/node/performance/).

We also now produce an ES6 version of our
[CDN tracing bundle](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/install/cdn/#performance-bundle), which can be accessed
with `bundle.tracing.es6.min.js`.

- chore(eslint): Turn on quotes rules (#4671)
- fix(node): prevent errors thrown on flush from breaking response (#4667)
- ref(node): Remove dependency on @sentry/tracing (#4647)
- fix(tracing): Make method required in transactionSampling type (#4657)
- feat(tracing): Add ES6 tracing bundle (#4674)

Work in this release contributed by @belgattitude, @pbernery, and @kylemh. Thank you for your contributions!

## 6.18.0

This patch deprecates the `frameContextLines` option for the Node SDK. The
[migration documentation](./MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6.17.x-to-6.18.0) details how to migrate off the deprecated
`frameContextLines` option.

- fix(browser): Only set event.stacktrace if we have 1 or more frames (#4614)
- fix(hub): keep hint event id if it's provided (#4577)

- fix(nextjs): Revert #4139 - remove manipulation of res.finished value (#4516)

Work in this release contributed by @mobilestar1. Thank you for your contribution!

## 6.17.5

This release deprecates the `Severity` enum, the `SeverityLevel` type, and the internal `SeverityLevels` array, all from
`@sentry/types`. In v7, `Severity` will disappear (in favor of `SeverityLevel`) and `SeverityLevel` and `SeverityLevels`
will live in `@sentry/utils`. If you are using any of the three, we encourage you to migrate your usage now, using our
[migration guide](./MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6.x-to-6.17.x).

- ref: Export Session class from core/browser/node (#4508)
- chore(nextjs): Bump`@sentry/webpack-plugin` to 1.18.5 (#4501)
- ref(types): Move SeverityLevel and SeverityLevels to `@sentry/utils` (#4492)

- fix(vue): Property `_isVue` not defined in Vue3 (#4461)

Work in this release contributed by @7inspire, @jaeseokk, and @rchl. Thank you for your contributions!

## 6.17.3

- fix(nextjs): Unwrap `req` and `res` if necessary when instrumenting server (#4467)

## 6.17.2

This patch contains a breaking change for anyone setting the undocumented `rethrowAfterCapture` option for
`@sentry/serverless`'s AWS wrapper to `false`, as its functionality has been removed. For backwards compatibility with
anyone setting it to `true` (which is also the default), the option remains in the `WrapperOptions` type for now. It
will be removed in the next major release, though, so we recommend removing it from your code.

- ref(serverless): Remove `rethrowAfterCapture` use in AWS lambda wrapper (#4448)
- fix(utils): Remove dom `is` casting (#4451)

Work in this release contributed by @datbth. Thank you for your contribution!

## 6.17.0

This release contains several internal refactors that help reduce the bundle size of the SDK and help prep for our
[upcoming major release](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/4240). There are no breaking changes in
this patch unless you are using our internal `Dsn` class, which has been removed. We also deprecated a few of our
typescript enums and our internal `API` class. We've detailed in our
[migration documentation](./MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6.x-to-6.17.x) how to update your sdk usage if you are using any
of these in your code.

## 6.0.0

_This major version release doesn't contain any breaking API/code changes._ Starting from the version `6.0.0`, all SDKs
that support sending sessions data will do so by default. See our
[Release Health](https://docs.sentry.io/product/releases/health/) docs to learn more. As of this version, it applies to
all Browser SDKs (Browser, React, Angular, Vue, Gatsby etc.). Node.js and other related Server SDKs will follow soon
after, in the minor `6.x` release. You can opt-out of this behavior by setting `autoSessionTracking: false` option
during SDK initialization.
