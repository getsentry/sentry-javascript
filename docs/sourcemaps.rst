Source Maps
===========

In various browsers Sentry supports deminifying JavaScript via source
maps. A source map is a file generated by your minifier which compresses a
mapping of the minified file to the original uncompressed version(s).

One important thing to note is that even though we support mapping files,
a users browser may not actually be able to collect the required
information for the server to generate a sourcemap.

Sentry requires the following to be able to map tracebacks to their source:

* A source map header or footer
* A publicly accessible uncompressed version of the source
* A line of context that includes a line number, column number, and filename

The first two items are the responsibility of you, the end-user, and you
can take care of publishing them as part of your build process. The latter
however, with an individual line of context, is severely crippled in many
browsers.

One thing to note is that Sentry will attempt to process the source map
before storing (or grouping) an event. This ensures that if we are able to
deminify the source, we'll be able to more effectively group similar
events over time.

Browser Support
---------------

In our experiences, the only browser that routinely delivers usable error
reports is **Google Chrome**.

For additional information, see this more up-to-date `wiki page
<https://github.com/ryanseddon/source-map/wiki/Source-maps:-languages,-tools-and-other-info>`_.

Generating a Source Map
-----------------------

While there are several compression libraries which support source maps,
as of writing our recommendation is to use `UglifyJS
<https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2>`_. That said, many tools such as
`webpack <http://webpack.github.io/>`_ and `browserify
<http://browserify.org/>`_.

As an example, we can look at how we used to do things with Sentry (pre-webpack):

::

    node_modules/uglify-js/bin/uglifyjs {input} \
      --source-map-root={relroot}/ \
      --source-map-url={name}.map.js \
      --source-map={relpath}/{name}.map.js -o {output}

We won't attempt to go into the complexities of source maps, so we
recommend taking a stab at compiling them, and running them against a
validator.

Validating a Source Map
-----------------------

We maintain an online validation tool that can be used to test your source
(and sourcemaps) against: `sourcemaps.io <http://sourcemaps.io>`_.

Uploading Source Maps to Sentry
-------------------------------

In many cases your application may sit behind firewalls or you simply
can't expose source code to the public. Sentry provides an abstraction
called **Releases** which you can attach source artifacts to.

The release API is intended to allow you to store source files (and
sourcemaps) within Sentry. This removes the requirement for them to be
web-accessible, and also removes any inconsistency that could come from
network flakiness (on either your end, or Sentry's end).

* Start by creating a new API key under your organization's API Keys nav
  (on the home).
* Ensure you you have ``project:write`` selected under scopes.
* You'll use HTTP basic auth with the api key being your username, and an
  empty value for the password.

Now you need to setup your build system to create a release, and attach
the various source files. You will want to upload all dist files (i.e. the
minified/shipped JS), the referenced sourcemaps, and the files that those
sourcemaps point to.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Create a new release
    $ curl https://app.getsentry.com/api/0/projects/:organization_slug/:project_slug/releases/ \
      -u [api_key]: \
      -X POST \
      -d '{"version": "abcdef"}' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

    {
      "dateCreated": "2015-03-06T04:51:32.723Z",
      "version": "2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9"
    }

.. code-block:: bash

    # Upload a file for the given release
    # Note: The filename should be the *full* url that this
    # would be referenced as in production.
    $ curl https://app.getsentry.com/api/0/projects/:organization_slug/:project_slug/releases/2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9/files/ \
      -u [api_key]: \
      -X POST \
      -F file=@README.rst \
      -F name="http://example.com/readme.rst"

    {
      "dateCreated": "2015-03-06T04:53:00.308Z",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream"
      },
      "id": "1",
      "name": "http://example.com/readme.rst",
      "sha1": "22591348ed129fe016c535654f6493737f0f9df6",
      "size": 452
    }

.. code-block:: bash

    # If you make a mistake, you can also simply clear out the release
    $ curl https://app.getsentry.com/api/0/projects/:organization_slug/:project_slug/releases/2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9/ \
      -u [api_key]: \
      -X DELETE

Additionally, you'll need to configure the client to send the ``release``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    Raven.config({
        release: '2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9'
    });

Note: You dont *have* to upload the source files (ref'd by sourcemaps),
but without them the grouping algorithm will not be as strong, and the UI
will not show any contextual source.

Additional information can be found in the `Releases API documentation
<https://docs.getsentry.com/hosted/api/releases/>`_.

    Working Behind a Firewall
    -------------------------

    While the recommended solution is to upload your source artifacts to
    Sentry, sometimes it's necessary to allow communication from Sentry's
    internal IPs. For more information on Sentry's public IPs, see :ref:`ip-ranges`.
