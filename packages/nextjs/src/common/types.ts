// The `NextApiHandler` and `WrappedNextApiHandler` types are the same as the official `NextApiHandler` type, except:
//
// a) The wrapped version returns only promises, because wrapped handlers are always async.
//
// b) Instead of having a return types based on `void` (Next < 12.1.6) or `unknown` (Next 12.1.6+), both the wrapped and
// unwrapped versions of the type have both. This doesn't matter to users, because they exist solely on one side of that
// version divide or the other. For us, though, it's entirely possible to have one version of Next installed in our
// local repo (as a dev dependency) and have another Next version installed in a test app which also has the local SDK
// linked in.
//
// In that case, if those two versions are on either side of the 12.1.6 divide, importing the official `NextApiHandler`
// type here would break the test app's build, because it would set up a situation in which the linked SDK's
// `withSentry` would refer to one version of the type (from the local repo's `node_modules`) while any typed handler in
// the test app would refer to the other version of the type (from the test app's `node_modules`). By using a custom
// version of the type compatible with both the old and new official versions, we can use any Next version we want in a
// test app without worrying about type errors.
//
// c) These have internal SDK flags which the official Next types obviously don't have, one to allow our auto-wrapping
// function, `withSentryAPI`, to pass the parameterized route into `withSentry`, and the other to prevent a manually
// wrapped route from being wrapped again by the auto-wrapper.
