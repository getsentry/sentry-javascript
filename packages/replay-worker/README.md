# Sentry Session Replay Worker

This is an internal package that is used by @sentry-internal/replay. It generates a web worker and converts it to a
string, so that we can process it easier in replay.

By extracting this into a dedicated (private, internal) package, we can streamline the build of replay.

## Example Worker

You can find an example worker for if you want to self-host the compression worker in [/examples](./examples/).

This is generated from the actual source via `yarn build:examples`, which should be run manually whenever replay-worker
is updated.
