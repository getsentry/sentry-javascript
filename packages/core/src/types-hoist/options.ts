   * - `tracePropagationTargets: [/^\/api/]` and request to `https://same-origin.com/api/posts`:
   *   - Tracing headers will be attached because the request is sent to the same origin and the regex matches the pathname "/api/posts".
   * - `tracePropagationTargets: [/^\/api/]` and request to `https://different-origin.com/api/posts`:
   *   - Tracing headers will not be attached because the pathname will only be compared when the request target lives on the same origin.
