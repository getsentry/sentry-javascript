 *
 * If an option from this base interface doesn't apply to an SDK, use the `Omit` utility type to exclude it.

 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import type { BuildTimeOptionsBase, UnstableVitePluginOptions } from '@sentry/core';
 * import type { SentryVitePluginOptions } from '@sentry/vite-plugin';
 *
 * // Example of how a framework SDK would define its build-time options
