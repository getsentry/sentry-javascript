/**
 * Sets an inactive span active on the current scope.
 *
 * This is useful in browser applications, if you want to create a span that cannot be finished
 * within its callback. Any spans started while the given span is active, will be children of the span.
 *
 * If there already was an active span on the scope prior to calling this function, it is replaced
 * with the given span and restored after the span ended. Otherwise, the span will simply be
 * removed, resulting in no active span on the scope.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This function can ONLY be used in the browser! Calling this function in a server
 * environment (for example in a server-side rendered component) will result in undefined behaviour
 * and is not supported.
 * You MUST call `span.end()` manually, otherwise the span will never be finished.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * let checkoutSpan;
 *
 * on('checkoutStarted', () => {
 *  checkoutSpan = Sentry.startInactiveSpan({ name: 'checkout-flow' });
 *  Sentry.setSpanActive(checkoutSpan);
 * })
 *
 * // during this time, any spans started will be children of `checkoutSpan`:
 * Sentry.startSpan({ name: 'checkout-step-1' }, () => {
 *  // ... `
 * })
 *
 * on('checkoutCompleted', () => {
 *  checkoutSpan?.end();
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * @param span - the span to set active

  // This also guards against users (for whatever reason) calling setSpanActive on SDK-started
