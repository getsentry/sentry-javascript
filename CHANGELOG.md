## Unreleased

- "You miss 100 percent of the chances you don't take. — Wayne Gretzky" — Michael Scott

- **feat(core): Make stream instrumentation opt-in
  ([#13951](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/13951))**

This change adds a new option `trackFetchStreamPerformance` to the browser tracing integration. Only when set to `true`,
Sentry will instrument streams via fetch.

## 8.29.0

### Important Changes

- **Beta releases of official Solid and SolidStart Sentry SDKs**

This release marks the beta releases of the `@sentry/solid` and `@sentry/solidstart` Sentry SDKs. For details on how to
use them, check out the
[Sentry Solid SDK README](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/develop/packages/solid) and the
[Sentry SolidStart SDK README](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/develop/packages/solidstart)
respectively. Please reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/new/choose) if you have
any feedback or concerns.

- **feat(node): Option to only wrap instrumented modules (#13139)**

Adds the SDK option to only wrap ES modules with `import-in-the-middle` that specifically need to be instrumented.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '__PUBLIC_DSN__',
  registerEsmLoaderHooks: { onlyIncludeInstrumentedModules: true },
});
```

## 8.28.0

### Important Changes

- **Beta release of official NestJS SDK**

This release contains the beta version of `@sentry/nestjs`! For details on how to use it, check out the
[README](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/nestjs/README.md). Any feedback/bug reports
are greatly appreciated, please reach out on GitHub.

- **fix(browser): Remove faulty LCP, FCP and FP normalization logic (#13502)**

This release fixes a bug in the `@sentry/browser` package and all SDKs depending on this package (e.g. `@sentry/react`
or `@sentry/nextjs`) that caused the SDK to send incorrect web vital values for the LCP, FCP and FP vitals. The SDK
previously incorrectly processed the original values as they were reported from the browser. When updating your SDK to
this version, you might experience an increase in LCP, FCP and FP values, which potentially leads to a decrease in your
performance score in the Web Vitals Insights module in Sentry. This is because the previously reported values were
smaller than the actually measured values. We apologize for the inconvenience!

### Other Changes

- feat(nestjs): Add `SentryGlobalGraphQLFilter` (#13545)
- feat(nestjs): Automatic instrumentation of nestjs interceptors after route execution (#13264)

- fix(node): Suppress tracing for transport request execution rather than transport creation (#13491)
- fix(replay): Consider more things as DOM mutations for dead clicks (#13518)
- fix(vue): Correctly obtain component name (#13484)

Work in this release was contributed by @leopoldkristjansson, @mhuggins and @filips123. Thank you for your
contributions!

## 8.27.0

### Important Changes

- **fix(nestjs): Exception filters in main app module are not being executed (#13278)**

  With this release nestjs error monitoring is no longer automatically set up after adding the `SentryModule` to your
  application, which led to issues in certain scenarios. You will now have to either add the `SentryGlobalFilter` to
  your main module providers or decorate the `catch()` method in your existing global exception filters with the newly
  released `@WithSentry()` decorator. See the [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nestjs/) for
  more details.

### Other Changes

- feat: Add options for passing nonces to feedback integration (#13347)

Work in this release was contributed by @charpeni. Thank you for your contribution!

## 8.26.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(node): Add `fsInstrumentation` (#13291)**

  This release adds `fsIntegration`, an integration that instruments the `fs` API to the Sentry Node SDK. The
  integration creates spans with naming patterns of `fs.readFile`, `fs.unlink`, and so on.

  This integration is not enabled by default and needs to be registered in your `Sentry.init` call. You can configure
  via options whether to include path arguments or error messages as span attributes when an fs call fails:

  ```js
  Sentry.init({
    integrations: [
      Sentry.fsIntegration({
        recordFilePaths: true,
        recordErrorMessagesAsSpanAttributes: true,
      }),
    ],
  });
  ```

  **WARNING:** This integration may add significant overhead to your application. Especially in scenarios with a lot of
  file I/O, like for example when running a framework dev server, including this integration can massively slow down
  your application.

## 8.20.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(node): Allow to pass `registerEsmLoaderHooks` to preload (#12998)**

You can write your own custom preload script and configure this in the preload options. `registerEsmLoaderHooks` can be
passed as an option to `preloadOpenTelemetry`, which allows to exclude/include packages in the preload.

- **fix(node): Do not emit fetch spans when tracing is disabled (#13003)**

Sentry will not emit "fetch" spans if tracing is disabled. This is relevant for user who use their own sampler.

## 8.18.0

### Important Changes

- **ref: Deprecate `enableTracing` (12897)**

The `enableTracing` option has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version. We recommend removing it
in favor of the `tracesSampleRate` and `tracesSampler` options. If you want to enable performance monitoring, please set
the `tracesSampleRate` to a sample rate of your choice, or provide a sampling function as `tracesSampler` option
instead. If you want to disable performance monitoring, remove the `tracesSampler` and `tracesSampleRate` options.

- fix(nuxt): Add module to build:transpile script (#12843)
- fix(browser): Allow SDK initialization in NW.js apps (#12846)

## 8.16.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(nextjs): Use spans generated by Next.js for App Router (#12729)**

Previously, the `@sentry/nextjs` SDK automatically recorded spans in the form of transactions for each of your top-level
server components (pages, layouts, ...). This approach had a few drawbacks, the main ones being that traces didn't have
a root span, and more importantly, if you had data stream to the client, its duration was not captured because the
server component spans had finished before the data could finish streaming.

With this release, we will capture the duration of App Router requests in their entirety as a single transaction with
server component spans being descendants of that transaction. This means you will get more data that is also more
accurate. Note that this does not apply to the Edge runtime. For the Edge runtime, the SDK will emit transactions as it
has before.

Generally speaking, this change means that you will see less _transactions_ and more _spans_ in Sentry. You will no
longer receive server component transactions like `Page Server Component (/path/to/route)` (unless using the Edge
runtime), and you will instead receive transactions for your App Router SSR requests that look like
`GET /path/to/route`.

If you are on Sentry SaaS, this may have an effect on your quota consumption: Less transactions, more spans.

- **- feat(nestjs): Add nest cron monitoring support (#12781)**

The `@sentry/nestjs` SDK now includes a `@SentryCron` decorator that can be used to augment the native NestJS `@Cron`
decorator to send check-ins to Sentry before and after each cron job run:

```typescript
import { Cron } from '@nestjs/schedule';
import { SentryCron, MonitorConfig } from '@sentry/nestjs';
import type { MonitorConfig } from '@sentry/types';

const monitorConfig: MonitorConfig = {
  schedule: {
    type: 'crontab',
    value: '* * * * *',
  },
  checkinMargin: 2, // In minutes. Optional.
  maxRuntime: 10, // In minutes. Optional.
  timezone: 'America/Los_Angeles', // Optional.
};

export class MyCronService {
  @Cron('* * * * *')
  @SentryCron('my-monitor-slug', monitorConfig)
  handleCron() {
    // Your cron job logic here
  }
}
```

## 8.13.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(nestjs): Add Nest SDK** This release adds a dedicated SDK for [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) (`@sentry/nestjs`)
  in alpha state. The SDK is a drop-in replacement for the Sentry Node SDK (`@sentry/node`) supporting the same set of
  features. See the [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nestjs/) for how to use the SDK.

### Other Changes

- feat(node): Add context info for missing instrumentation (#12639)
- fix(feedback): Improve feedback error message (#12647)

## 8.12.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(solid): Remove need to pass router hooks to solid integration** (breaking)

This release introduces breaking changes to the `@sentry/solid` package (which is currently out in alpha).

We've made it easier to get started with the solid router integration by removing the need to pass **use\*** hooks
explicitly to `solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration`. Import `solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration` from
`@sentry/solid/solidrouter` and add it to `Sentry.init`

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/solid';
import { solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration, withSentryRouterRouting } from '@sentry/solid/solidrouter';
import { Router } from '@solidjs/router';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '__PUBLIC_DSN__',
  integrations: [solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, //  Capture 100% of the transactions
});

const SentryRouter = withSentryRouterRouting(Router);
```

- **feat(core): Return client from init method (#12585)**

`Sentry.init()` now returns a client directly, so you don't need to explicitly call `getClient()` anymore:

```js
const client = Sentry.init();
```

- **feat(nextjs): Add `deleteSourcemapsAfterUpload` option (#12457)**

This adds an easy way to delete sourcemaps immediately after uploading them:

```js
module.exports = withSentryConfig(nextConfig, {
  sourcemaps: {
    deleteSourcemapsAfterUpload: true,
  },
});
```

- **feat(node): Allow to configure `maxSpanWaitDuration` (#12610)**

Adds configuration option for the max. duration in seconds that the SDK will wait for parent spans to be finished before
discarding a span. The SDK will automatically clean up spans that have no finished parent after this duration. This is
necessary to prevent memory leaks in case of parent spans that are never finished or otherwise dropped/missing. However,
if you have very long-running spans in your application, a shorter duration might cause spans to be discarded too early.
In this case, you can increase this duration to a value that fits your expected data.

### Other Changes

- feat(feedback): Extra check for iPad in screenshot support (#12593)
- fix(bundle): Ensure CDN bundles do not overwrite `window.Sentry` (#12580)
- fix(feedback): Inject preact from feedbackModal into feedbackScreenshot integration (#12535)
- fix(node): Re-throw errors from koa middleware (#12609)
- fix(remix): Mark `isRemixV2` as optional in exposed types. (#12614)
- ref(node): Add error message to NodeFetch log (#12612)

Work in this release was contributed by @n4bb12. Thank you for your contribution!

## 8.11.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(core): Add `parentSpan` option to `startSpan*` APIs (#12567)**

We've made it easier to create a span as a child of a specific span via the startSpan\* APIs. This should allow you to
explicitly manage the parent-child relationship of your spans better.

```js
Sentry.startSpan({ name: 'root' }, parent => {
  const span = Sentry.startInactiveSpan({ name: 'xxx', parentSpan: parent });

  Sentry.startSpan({ name: 'xxx', parentSpan: parent }, () => {});

  Sentry.startSpanManual({ name: 'xxx', parentSpan: parent }, () => {});
});
```

### Other Changes

- feat(node): Detect release from more providers (#12529)
- fix(profiling-node): Use correct getGlobalScope import (#12564)
- fix(profiling-node) sample timestamps need to be in seconds (#12563)
- ref: Align `@sentry/node` exports from framework SDKs. (#12589)

## 8.10.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(remix): Migrate to `opentelemetry-instrumentation-remix`. (#12110)**

You can now simplify your remix instrumentation by opting-in like this:

```js
const Sentry = require('@sentry/remix');

Sentry.init({
  dsn: YOUR_DSN
  // opt-in to new auto instrumentation
  autoInstrumentRemix: true,
});
```

With this setup, you do not need to add e.g. `wrapExpressCreateRequestHandler` anymore. Additionally, the quality of the
captured data improves. The old way to use `@sentry/remix` continues to work, but it is encouraged to use the new setup.

### Other Changes

- feat(browser): Export `thirdPartyErrorFilterIntegration` from `@sentry/browser` (#12512)
- feat(feedback): Allow passing `tags` field to any feedback config param (#12197)

## 8.9.0

This release failed to publish correctly, please use `8.9.1` instead.

## 8.8.0

- **feat: Upgrade OTEL dependencies (#12388)**

This upgrades the OpenTelemetry dependencies to the latest versions and makes OTEL use `import-in-the-middle` `v1.8.0`.
This should fix numerous issues with using OTEL instrumentation with ESM.

High level issues fixed with OTEL + ESM:

- incompatibilities with using multiple loaders, commonly encountered while using `tsx` or similar libraries.
- incompatibilities with libraries that use duplicate namespace exports like `date-fns`.
- incompatibilities with libraries that use self-referencing namespace imports like `openai`.
- incompatibilities with dynamic export patterns like exports with function calls.
- `ENOENT: no such file or directory` bugs that libraries like [`discord.js`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
  surface.

If you are still encountering issues with OpenTelemetry instrumentation and ESM, please let us know.

## 8.7.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(react): Add TanStack Router integration (#12095)**

  This release adds instrumentation for TanStack router with a new `tanstackRouterBrowserTracingIntegration` in the
  `@sentry/react` SDK:

  ```javascript
  import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';
  import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router';

  const router = createRouter({
    // Your router options...
  });

  Sentry.init({
    dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    integrations: [Sentry.tanstackRouterBrowserTracingIntegration(router)],
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  });
  ```

### Other Changes

- fix(nextjs): Do not hide `sourceMappingURL` comment on client when `nextConfig.productionBrowserSourceMaps: true` is
  set (#12278)

## 8.6.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(metrics): Add `timings` method to metrics (#12226)**

  This introduces a new method, `metrics.timing()`, which can be used in two ways:

  1. With a numeric value, to simplify creating a distribution metric. This will default to `second` as unit:

  ```js
  Sentry.metrics.timing('myMetric', 100);
  ```

  2. With a callback, which will wrap the duration of the callback. This can accept a sync or async callback. It will
     create an inactive span around the callback and at the end emit a metric with the duration of the span in seconds:

  ```js
  const returnValue = Sentry.metrics.timing('myMetric', measureThisFunction);
  ```

- **feat(react): Add `Sentry.reactErrorHandler` (#12147)**

  This PR introduces `Sentry.reactErrorHandler`, which you can use in React 19 as follows:

  ```js
  import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';
  import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

  ReactDOM.hydrateRoot(
    document.getElementById('root'),
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>,
    {
      onUncaughtError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler(),
      onCaughtError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler((error, errorInfo) => {
        // optional callback if users want custom config.
      }),
    },
  );
  ```

  For more details, take a look at [the PR](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/12147). Our
  documentation will be updated soon!

- fix(tracing): Ensure sent spans are limited to 1000 (#12252)
- ref(core): Use versioned carrier on global object (#12206)

## 8.5.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(react): Add React 19 to peer deps (#12207)**

This release adds support for React 19 in the `@sentry/react` SDK package.

- **feat(node): Add `@sentry/node/preload` hook (#12213)**

This release adds a new way to initialize `@sentry/node`, which allows you to use the SDK with performance
instrumentation even if you cannot call `Sentry.init()` at the very start of your app.

First, run the SDK like this:

```bash
node --require @sentry/node/preload ./app.js
```

Now, you can initialize and import the rest of the SDK later or asynchronously:

```js
const express = require('express');
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

const dsn = await getSentryDsn();
Sentry.init({ dsn });
```

For more details, head over to the
[PR Description of the new feature](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/12213). Our docs will be updated
soon with a new guide.

## 8.4.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(nextjs): Trace pageloads in App Router (#12157)**

If you are using Next.js version `14.3.0-canary.64` or above, the Sentry Next.js SDK will now trace clientside pageloads
with React Server Components. This means, that client-side errors like
`Error: An error occurred in the Server Components render.`, which previously didn't give you much information on how
that error was caused, can now be traced back to a specific error in a server component.

- **feat(angular): Add Support for Angular 18 (#12183)**

This release guarantees support for Angular 18 with `@sentry/angular`.

### Other Changes

When using Sentry in ESM mode, you can now use Sentry without manually calling init like this:

```bash
 SENTRY_DSN=https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0 node --import=@sentry/node/init app.mjs
```

When using CommonJS, you can do:

```bash
 SENTRY_DSN=https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0 node --require=@sentry/node/init app.js
```

and reporting issues - we appreciate your support!

---

### How to Upgrade to Version 8:

We recommend reading the
[migration guide docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/migration/v7-to-v8/#migration-codemod) to find out
how to address any breaking changes in your code for your specific platform or framework.

To automate upgrading to v8 as much as possible, use our migration codemod `@sentry/migr8`:

```sh
npx @sentry/migr8@latest
```

All deprecations from the v7 cycle, with the exception of `getCurrentHub()`, have been removed and can no longer be used
in v8. If you have an advanced Sentry SDK setup, we additionally recommend reading the
[in-depth migration guide](./MIGRATION.md) in our repo which highlights all changes with additional details and
information.

The rest of this changelog highlights the most important (breaking) changes and links to more detailed information.

### Version Support

With v8, we dropped support for several old runtimes and browsers

**Node SDKs:** The Sentry JavaScript SDK v8 now supports **Node.js 14.8.0 or higher**. This applies to `@sentry/node`
and all of our node-based server-side sdks (`@sentry/nextjs`, `@sentry/remix`, etc.). Furthermore, version 8 now ships
with full support for ESM-based node apps using **Node.js 18.19.0 or higher**.

**Browser SDKs:** The browser SDKs now require
[**ES2018+**](https://caniuse.com/?feats=mdn-javascript_builtins_regexp_dotall,js-regexp-lookbehind,mdn-javascript_builtins_regexp_named_capture_groups,mdn-javascript_builtins_regexp_property_escapes,mdn-javascript_builtins_symbol_asynciterator,mdn-javascript_functions_method_definitions_async_generator_methods,mdn-javascript_grammar_template_literals_template_literal_revision,mdn-javascript_operators_destructuring_rest_in_objects,mdn-javascript_operators_destructuring_rest_in_arrays,promise-finally)
compatible browsers. New minimum browser versions:

- Chrome 71
- Edge 79
- Safari 12.1, iOS Safari 12.2
- Firefox 65
- Opera 58
- Samsung Internet 10

For more details, please see the
[version support section in our migration guide](./MIGRATION.md#1-version-support-changes).

### Initializing Server-side SDKs (Node, Bun, Deno, Serverless):

In v8, we support a lot more node-based packages than before. In order to ensure auto-instrumentation works, the SDK now
needs to be imported and initialized before any other import in your code.

We recommend creating a new file (e.g. `instrumentation.js`) to import and initialize the SDK. Then, import the file on
top of your entry file or detailed instructions, check our updated SDK setup docs
[initializing the SDK in v8](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/node/).

### Performance Monitoring Changes

The API around performance monitoring and tracing has been streamlined, and we've added support for more integrations
out of the box.

- [Performance Monitoring API](./MIGRATION.md#performance-monitoring-api)
- [Performance Monitoring Integrations](./MIGRATION.md#performance-monitoring-integrations)

### Functional Integrations

Integrations are now simple functions instead of classes. Class-based integrations
[have been removed](./MIGRATION.md#removal-of-class-based-integrations):

```javascript
// old (v7)
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],
});

// new (v8)
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
});
```

### Package removal

The following packages have been removed or replaced and will no longer be published:

- [`@sentry/hub`](./MIGRATION.md#sentryhub)
- [`@sentry/tracing`](./MIGRATION.md#sentrytracing)
- [`@sentry/integrations`](./MIGRATION.md#sentryintegrations)
- [`@sentry/serverless`](./MIGRATION.md#sentryserverless)
- [`@sentry/replay`](./MIGRATION.md#sentryreplay)

### Changes since `8.0.0-rc.3`

- **feat(nextjs): Remove `transpileClientSDK` (#11978)**

  As we are dropping support for Internet Explorer 11 and other other older browser versions wih version `8.0.0`, we are
  also removing the `transpileClientSDK` option from the Next.js SDK. If you need to support these browser versions,
  please configure Webpack and Next.js to down-compile the SDK.

- **feat(serverless): Do not include performance integrations by default (#11998)**

  To keep Lambda bundle size reasonable, the SDK no longer ships with all performance (database) integrations by
  default. Add the Sentry integrations of the databases and other tools you're using manually to your `Sentry.init` call
  by following
  [this guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/#modifying-default-integrations).
  Note that this change does not apply if you use the SDK with the Sentry AWS Lambda layer.

This release includes adds support for ESM when `Sentry.init()` is called within a module imported via the `--import`
Node.js flag:

```sh
node --import ./your-file-with-sentry-init.mjs your-app.mjs
```

Note that the SDK only supports ESM for node versions `18.19.0` and above, and `20.6.0` above.

### Other Changes

- deps(node): Bump `@opentelemetry/core` to `1.24.1` and `@opentelemetry/instrumentation` to `0.51.1` (#11941)
- feat(connect): Warn if connect is not instrumented (#11936)

### Important Changes

- **feat(svelte): Add Svelte 5 support (#11807)**

We now officially support Svelte 5.

- **feat(browser): Send standalone fetch and XHR spans if there's no active parent span (#11783)**

Starting with this version, spans for outgoing fetch/xhr requests will be captured even if no pageload/navigation span
is ongoing. This means that you will be able to have a more complete trace, especially for web applications that make a
lot of HTTP requests on longer lived pages.

### Other Changes

- feat(astro): Add `transactionName` to isolation scope for requests (#11786)
- feat(browser): Create standalone INP spans via `startInactiveSpan` (#11788)

## 8.0.0-beta.4

### Important Changes

- **feat(browser): Add INP support for v8 (#11650)**

INP web vital support was now forward-ported to version 8. Recording of INP data is enabled by default.

- **feat(core): Increase default transport buffer size from 30 to 64 (#11764)**

The default limit of queued events to be sent was increased from 30 to 64 events. You may observe a higher memory
footprint of the SDK. You can override this limit by setting the `transportOptions.bufferSize` option in
`Sentry.init()`.

- **feat(replay): Add "maxCanvasSize" option for replay canvases (#11617)**

A `maxCanvasSize` option was added to the `replayCanvasIntegration` to disallow capturing of canvases larger than a
certain size. This value defaults to `1280` which will not capture canvases bigger than 1280x1280 pixels.

### Other Changes

- deps: Downgrade `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-http` to `0.48.0` (#11745)
- deps(nextjs): Remove unnecessary and faulty `@opentelemetry/api` dependency from Next.js package (#11717)

- fix(serverless): Check if cloud event callback is a function (#9044) (#11701)
- ref(nextjs): Remove unnecessary logic to filter symbolification/sentry spans (#11714)

## 8.0.0-beta.3

### Important Changes

- **feat(opentelemetry): Add `addOpenTelemetryInstrumentation` (#11667)**

A utility function `addOpenTelemetryInstrumentation` was added that allows for the registration of instrumentations that
conform to the OpenTelemetry JS API without having to specify `@opentelemetry/instrumentation` as a dependency.

- **ref(core): Don't start transaction for trpc middleware (#11697)**

Going forward, the Sentry `trpcMiddleware` will only create spans. Previously it used to always create a transaction.
This change was made to integrate more nicely with the HTTP instrumentation added in earlier versions to avoid creating
unnecessary transactions.

### Other Changes

- feat(nextjs): Instrument outgoing http requests (#11685)
- feat(opentelemetry): Remove setupGlobalHub (#11668)
- fix: Missing ErrorEvent export are added to node, browser, bun, deno, vercel-edge sub-packages (#11649)
- fix(nextjs): Do not sample next spans if they have remote parent (#11680)
- fix(nextjs): Re-enable OTEL fetch instrumentation and disable Next.js fetch instrumentation (#11686)
- fix(node): Ensure DSC on envelope header uses root span (#11683)
- ref(browser): Streamline pageload span creation and scope handling (#11679)
- ref(core): Directly use endSession (#11669)

## 8.0.0-beta.2

### Important Changes

- **feat(browser): Update `propagationContext` on `spanEnd` to keep trace consistent**

To ensure consistency throughout a route's duration, we update the scope's propagation context when the initial page
load or navigation span ends. This keeps span-specific attributes like the sampled decision and dynamic sampling context
on the scope, even after the transaction has ended.

- **fix(browser): Don't assume window.document is available (#11602)**

We won't assume `window.dodument` is available in the browser SDKs anymore. This should prevent errors in environments
where `window.document` is not available (such as web workers).

### Other changes

- feat(core): Add `server.address` to browser `http.client` spans (#11634)
- feat(opentelemetry): Update OTEL packages & relax some version ranges (#11580)
- feat(deps): bump @opentelemetry/instrumentation-hapi from 0.34.0 to 0.36.0 (#11496)
- feat(deps): bump @opentelemetry/instrumentation-koa from 0.37.0 to 0.39.0 (#11495)
- feat(deps): bump @opentelemetry/instrumentation-pg from 0.38.0 to 0.40.0 (#11494)
- feat(nextjs): Skip OTEL root spans emitted by Next.js (#11623)
- feat(node): Collect Local Variables via a worker (#11586)
- fix(nextjs): Escape Next.js' OpenTelemetry instrumentation (#11625)
- fix(feedback): Fix timeout on feedback submission (#11619)
- fix(node): Allow use of `NodeClient` without calling `init` (#11585)
- fix(node): Ensure DSC is correctly set in envelope headers (#11628)

## 8.0.0-beta.1

This is the first beta release of Sentry JavaScript SDK v8. With this release, there are no more planned breaking
changes for the v8 cycle.

Read the [in-depth migration guide](./MIGRATION.md) to find out how to address any breaking changes in your code. All
deprecations from the v7 cycle, with the exception of `getCurrentHub()`, have been removed and can no longer be used in
v8.

### Version Support

The Sentry JavaScript SDK v8 now supports Node.js 14.8.0 or higher. This applies to `@sentry/node` and all of our
node-based server-side sdks (`@sentry/nextjs`, `@sentry/remix`, etc.).

The browser SDKs now require
[ES2018+](https://caniuse.com/?feats=mdn-javascript_builtins_regexp_dotall,js-regexp-lookbehind,mdn-javascript_builtins_regexp_named_capture_groups,mdn-javascript_builtins_regexp_property_escapes,mdn-javascript_builtins_symbol_asynciterator,mdn-javascript_functions_method_definitions_async_generator_methods,mdn-javascript_grammar_template_literals_template_literal_revision,mdn-javascript_operators_destructuring_rest_in_objects,mdn-javascript_operators_destructuring_rest_in_arrays,promise-finally)
compatible browsers. New minimum browser versions:

- Chrome 63
- Edge 79
- Safari/iOS Safari 12
- Firefox 58
- Opera 50
- Samsung Internet 8.2

For more details, please see the [version support section in migration guide](./MIGRATION.md#1-version-support-changes).

### Package removal

The following packages will no longer be published

- [@sentry/hub](./MIGRATION.md#sentryhub)
- [@sentry/tracing](./MIGRATION.md#sentrytracing)
- [@sentry/integrations](./MIGRATION.md#sentryintegrations)
- [@sentry/serverless](./MIGRATION.md#sentryserverless)
- [@sentry/replay](./MIGRATION.md#sentryreplay)

### Initializing Server-side SDKs (Node, Bun, Next.js, SvelteKit, Astro, Remix):

Initializing the SDKs on the server-side has been simplified. More details in our migration docs about
[initializing the SDK in v8](./MIGRATION.md/#initializing-the-node-sdk).

### Performance Monitoring Changes

The API around performance monitoring and tracing has been vastly improved, and we've added support for more
integrations out of the box.

- [Performance Monitoring API](./MIGRATION.md#performance-monitoring-api)
- [Performance Monitoring Integrations](./MIGRATION.md#performance-monitoring-integrations)

### Important Changes since v8.0.0-alpha.9

- **feat(browser): Create spans as children of root span by default (#10986)**

Because execution context isolation in browser environments does not work reliably, we deciced to keep a flat span
hierarchy by default in v8.

- **feat(core): Deprecate `addTracingExtensions` (#11579)**

Instead of calling `Sentry.addTracingExtensions()` if you want to use performance in a browser SDK without using
`browserTracingIntegration()`, you should now call `Sentry.registerSpanErrorInstrumentation()`.

- **feat(core): Implement `suppressTracing` (#11468)**

You can use the new `suppressTracing` API to ensure a given callback will not generate any spans:

```js
return Sentry.suppressTracing(() => {
  // Ensure this fetch call does not generate a span
  return fetch('/my-url');
});
```

- **feat: Rename ESM loader hooks to `import` and `loader` (#11498)**

We renamed the loader hooks for better clarity:

```sh
# For Node.js <= 18.18.2
node --loader=@sentry/node/loader app.js

# For Node.js >= 18.19.0
node --import=@sentry/node/import app.js
```

- **feat(node): Do not exit process by default when other `onUncaughtException` handlers are registered in
  `onUncaughtExceptionIntegration` (#11532)**

In v8, we will no longer exit the node process by default if other uncaught exception handlers have been registered by
the user.

- **Better handling of transaction name for errors**

We improved the way we keep the transaction name for error events, even when spans are not sampled or performance is
disabled.

- feat(fastify): Update scope `transactionName` when handling request (#11447)
- feat(hapi): Update scope `transactionName` when handling request (#11448)
- feat(koa): Update scope `transactionName` when creating router span (#11476)
- feat(sveltekit): Update scope transactionName when handling server-side request (#11511)
- feat(nestjs): Update scope transaction name with parameterized route (#11510)

## 8.0.0-beta.0

This release failed to publish correctly. Use 8.0.0-beta.1 instead.

## 8.0.0-alpha.9

This is the eighth alpha release of Sentry JavaScript SDK v8, which includes a variety of breaking changes.

Read the [in-depth migration guide](./MIGRATION.md) to find out how to address any breaking changes in your code.

### Important Changes

- **feat: Add @sentry-internal/browser-utils (#11381)**

A big part of the browser-runtime specific exports of the internal `@sentry/utils` package were moved into a new package
`@sentry-internal/browser-utils`. If you imported any API from `@sentry/utils` (which is generally not recommended but
necessary for some workarounds), please check that your import statements still point to existing exports after
upgrading.

- **feat: Add loader file to node-based SDKs to support ESM monkeypatching (#11338)**

When using ESM, it is necessary to use a "loader" to be able to instrument certain third-party packages and Node.js API.
The server-side SDKs now ship with a set of ESM loader hooks, that should be used when using ESM. Use them as follows:

```sh
# For Node.js <= 18.18.2
node --experimental-loader=@sentry/node/hook your-app.js

# For Node.js >= 18.19.0
node --import=@sentry/node/register your-app.js
```

Please note that due to an upstream bug, these loader hooks will currently crash or simply not work. We are planning to
fix this in upcoming versions of the SDK - definitely before a stable version 8 release.

- **feat(node): Add Koa error handler (#11403)**
- **feat(node): Add NestJS error handler (#11375)**

The Sentry SDK now exports integrations and error middlewares for Koa (`koaIntegration()`, `setupKoaErrorHandler()`) and
NestJS (`setupNestErrorHandler()`) that can be used to instrument your Koa and NestJS applications with error
monitoring.

This is the seventh alpha release of Sentry JavaScript SDK v8, which includes a variety of breaking changes.

Read the [in-depth migration guide](./MIGRATION.md) to find out how to address any breaking changes in your code.

### Important Changes

- **feat(nextjs): Use OpenTelemetry for performance monitoring and tracing (#11016)**

We now use OpenTelemetry under the hood to power performance monitoring and tracing in the Next.js SDK.

- **feat(v8/gatsby): Update SDK initialization for gatsby (#11292)**

In v8, you cannot initialize the SDK anymore via Gatsby plugin options. Instead, you have to configure the SDK in a
`sentry.config.js` file.

We also removed the automatic initialization of `browserTracingIntegration`. You now have to add this integration
yourself.

## 8.0.0-alpha.6

This version did not publish correctly due to a configuration issue.

## 8.0.0-alpha.5

This is the fifth alpha release of Sentry JavaScript SDK v8, which includes a variety of breaking changes.

Read the [in-depth migration guide](./MIGRATION.md) to find out how to address any breaking changes in your code.

### Important Changes

- **feat(nextjs): Remove `client.(server|client).config.ts` functionality in favor of `instrumentation.ts` (#11059)**
  - feat(nextjs): Bump minimum required Next.js version to `13.2.0` (#11097)

With version 8 of the SDK we will no longer support the use of `sentry.server.config.ts` and `sentry.edge.config.ts`
files. Instead, please initialize the Sentry Next.js SDK for the serverside in a
[Next.js instrumentation hook](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation).
**`sentry.client.config.ts|js` is still supported and encouraged for initializing the clientside SDK.** Please see the
[Migration Guide](./MIGRATION.md#updated-the-recommended-way-of-calling-sentryinit) for more details.

In addition, the Next.js SDK now requires a minimum Next.js version of `13.2.0`.

- **feat(v8/angular): Merge angular and angular-ivy packages and start Angular support at v14 (#11091)**

The `@sentry/angular-ivy` package has been removed. The `@sentry/angular` package now supports Ivy by default and
requires at least Angular 14. See the [Migration Guide](./MIGRATION.md#removal-of-sentryangular-ivy-package) for more
details.

## 8.0.0-alpha.4

This is the fourth Alpha release of the v8 cycle, which includes a variety of breaking changes.

Read the [in-depth migration guide](./MIGRATION.md) to find out how to address any breaking changes in your code.

### Important Changes

- **feat: Set required node version to >=14.18.0 for all packages (#10968)**

The minimum Node version required for the SDK is now `14.18.0`.

- **Serverless SDK Changes**
  - feat(google-cloud): Add @sentry/google-cloud package (#10993)
  - feat(v8): Add @sentry/aws-serverless package (#11052)
  - feat(v8): Rename gcp package to `@sentry/google-cloud-serverless` (#11065)

`@sentry/serverless` is no longer published, and is replaced by two new packages: `@sentry/google-cloud-serverless` and
`@sentry/aws-serverless`. These packages are now the recommended way to instrument serverless functions. See the
[migration guide](./MIGRATION.md#sentryserverless) for more details.

- **build(bundles): Use ES2017 for bundles (drop ES5 support) (#10911)**

The Browser SDK and CDN bundles now emits ES2017 compatible code and drops support for IE11. This also means that the
Browser SDKs (`@sentry/browser`, `@sentry/react`, `@sentry/vue`, etc.) requires the fetch API to be available in the
environment. If you need to support older browsers, please transpile your code to ES5 using babel or similar and add
required polyfills.

New minimum supported browsers:

- Chrome 58
- Edge 15
- Safari/iOS Safari 11
- Firefox 54
- Opera 45
- Samsung Internet 7.2

## 8.0.0-alpha.1

This is the first Alpha release of the v8 cycle, which includes a variety of breaking changes.

Read the [in-depth migration guide](./MIGRATION.md) to find out how to address any breaking changes in your code.

### Important Changes

**- feat(node): Make `@sentry/node` powered by OpenTelemetry (#10762)**

The biggest change is the switch to use OpenTelemetry under the hood in `@sentry/node`. This brings with it a variety of
changes:

- There is now automated performance instrumentation for Express, Fastify, Nest.js and Koa. You can remove any
  performance and request isolation code you previously wrote manually for these frameworks.
- All performance instrumention is enabled by default, and will only take effect if the instrumented package is used.
  You don't need to use `autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations()` anymore.
- You need to ensure to call `Sentry.init()` _before_ you import any other packages. Otherwise, the packages cannot be
  instrumented:

```js
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '...',
  // ... other config here
});
// now require other things below this!
const http = require('http');
const express = require('express');
// ....
```

- Currently, we only support CJS-based Node application out of the box. There is experimental ESM support, see
  [the instructions](./packages/node-experimental/README.md#esm-support).
- `startTransaction` and `span.startChild()` are no longer supported. This is due to the underlying change to
  OpenTelemetry powered performance instrumentation. See
  [docs on the new performance APIs](./docs/v8-new-performance-apis.md) for details.

**- feat: Remove `@sentry/integrations` package (#10799)**

This package is no longer published. You can instead import these pluggable integrations directly from your SDK package
(e.g. `@sentry/browser` or `@sentry/react`).

**- feat: Remove `@sentry/hub` package (#10783)**

This package is no longer published. You can instead import directly from your SDK package (e.g. `@sentry/react` or
`@sentry/node`).

**- feat(v8): Remove @sentry/tracing (#10625)**

This package is no longer published. You can instead import directly from your SDK package (e.g. `@sentry/react` or
`@sentry/node`).

**- feat: Set required node version to >=14.8.0 for all packages (#10834)**

The minimum required node version is now 14.8+. If you need support for older node versions, you can stay on the v7
branch.

**- Removed class-based integrations**

We have removed most of the deprecated class-based integrations. Instead, you can use the functional styles:

```js

**- feat(v8/browser): Remove XHR transport (#10703)**

We have removed the XHR transport, and are instead using the fetch-based transport now by default. This means that if
you are using Sentry in a browser environment without fetch, you'll need to either provide a fetch polyfill, or provide
a custom transport to Sentry.

**- feat(sveltekit): Update `@sentry/vite-plugin` to 2.x and adjust options API (#10813)**

We have updated `@sentry/sveltekit` to use the latest version of `@sentry/vite-plugin`, which lead to changes in
configuration options.
