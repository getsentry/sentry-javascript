### Important Changes

- **fix(browser/v7): Continuously record CLS (#11935)**

This release fixes a bug that caused the cumulative layout shift (CLS) web vital not to be reported in a majority of the
cases where it should have been reported. With this change, the CLS web vital should now always be reported for
pageloads with layout shift. If a pageload did not have layout shift, no CLS web vital should be reported.

**Please note that upgrading the SDK to this version may cause data in your dashboards to drastically change.**

### Other Changes

- build(aws-lambda/v7): Turn off lambda layer publishing (#11875)
- feat(v7): Add `tunnel` support to multiplexed transport (#11851)
- fix(opentelemetry-node): support `HTTP_REQUEST_METHOD` attribute (#11929)
- fix(react/v7): Fix react router v4/v5 span names (#11940)

## 7.113.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(node): Support Node 22 (#11754)**

This release adds support for Node 22! ðŸŽ‰

It also adds prebuilt-binaries for Node 22 to `@sentry/profiling-node`.

### Other Changes

- feat(feedback): [v7] New feedback button design (#11841)
- feat(replay/v7): Upgrade rrweb packages to 2.15.0 (#11752)
- fix(ember/v7): Ensure unnecessary spans are avoided (#11848)

## 7.112.2

- fix(nextjs|sveltekit): Ensure we can pass `browserTracingIntegration` (#11765)

## 7.112.1

- fix(ember/v7): Do not create rendering spans without transaction (#11750)

## 7.112.0

### Important Changes

- **feat: Export pluggable integrations from SDK packages (#11723)**

Instead of installing `@sentry/integrations`, you can now import the pluggable integrations directly from your SDK
package:

```js
// Before
import * as Sentry fromv '@sentry/browser';
import { dedupeIntegration } from '@sentry/integrations';

Sentry.init({
  integrations: [dedupeIntegration()],
});

// After
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({
  integrations: [Sentry.dedupeIntegration()],
});
```

Note that only the functional integrations (e.g. `xxxIntegration()`) are re-exported.

### Other Changes

- feat(replay): Add "maxCanvasSize" option for replay canvases (#11732)
- fix(serverless): [v7] Check if cloud event callback is a function (#11734)

## 7.111.0

- feat(core): Add `server.address` to browser `http.client` spans (#11663)
- fix: Ensure next & sveltekit correctly handle `browserTracingIntegration` (#11647)
- fix(browser): Don't assume window.document is available (#11598)

## 7.110.1

- fix(nextjs): Fix `tunnelRoute` matching logic for hybrid cloud (#11577)

## 7.110.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(tracing): Add interactions sample rate to browser tracing integrations (#11382)**

You can now use a `interactionsSampleRate` to control the sample rate of INP spans. `interactionsSampleRate` is applied
on top of the global `tracesSampleRate`. Therefore if `interactionsSampleRate` is `0.5` and `tracesSampleRate` is `0.1`,
then the actual sample rate for interactions is `0.05`.

```js
Sentry.init({
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({
      interactionsSampleRate: 0.5,
    }),
  ],
});
```

- **Deprecations**

This release deprecates the `Hub` class, as well as the `addRequestDataToTransaction` method. The `trpcMiddleware`
method is no longer on the `Handlers` export, but instead is a standalone export.

Please see the detailed [Migration docs](./MIGRATION.md#deprecations-in-7x) on how to migrate to the new APIs.

- feat: Deprecate and relocate `trpcMiddleware` (#11389)

## 7.107.0

This release fixes issues with INP instrumentation with the Next.js SDK and adds support for the `enableInp` option in
the deprecated `BrowserTracing` integration for backwards compatibility.

- feat(performance): Port INP span instrumentation to old browser tracing (#11085)
- fix(ember): Ensure browser tracing is correctly lazy loaded (#11027)

Work in this release contributed by @jessezhang91 and @bfontaine. Thank you for your contributions!

## 7.105.0

### Important Changes

- **feat: Ensure `withActiveSpan` is exported everywhere (#10877)**

You can use the `withActiveSpan` method to ensure a certain span is the active span in a given callback. This can be
used to create a span as a child of a specific span with the `startSpan` API methods:

```js
const parentSpan = Sentry.startInactiveSpan({ name: 'parent' });
if (parentSpan) {
  withActiveSpan(parentSpan, () => {
    // This will be a direct child of parentSpan
    const childSpan = Sentry.startInactiveSpan({ name: 'child' });
  });
}
```

## 7.104.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(performance): create Interaction standalone spans on inp events (#10709)**

This release adds support for the INP web vital. This is currently only supported for Saas Sentry, and product support
is released with the upcoming `24.3.0` release of self-hosted.

To opt-in to this feature, you can use the `enableInp` option in the `browserTracingIntegration`:

```js
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({
      enableInp: true,
    });
  ]
})
```

### Other Changes

- feat(feedback): Flush replays when feedback form opens (#10567)
- feat(profiling-node): Expose `nodeProfilingIntegration` (#10864)
- fix(profiling-node): Fix dependencies to point to current versions (#10861)
- fix(replay): Add `errorHandler` for replayCanvas integration (#10796)

## 7.103.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(core): Allow to pass `forceTransaction` to `startSpan()` APIs (#10819)**

You can now pass `forceTransaction: true` to `startSpan()`, `startSpanManual()` and `startInactiveSpan()`. This allows
you to start a span that you want to be a transaction, if possible. Under the hood, the SDK will connect this span to
the running active span (if there is one), but still send the new span as a transaction to the Sentry backend, if
possible, ensuring it shows up as a transaction throughout the system.

Please note that setting this to `true` does not _guarantee_ that this will be sent as a transaction, but that the SDK
will try to do so. You can enable this flag if this span is important to you and you want to ensure that you can see it
in the Sentry UI.

### Other Changes

## 7.100.0

### Important Changes

#### Deprecations

This release includes some deprecations. For more details please look at our
[migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md).

The deprecation most likely to affect you is the one of `BrowserTracing`. Instead of `new BrowserTracing()`, you should
now use `browserTracingIntegration()`, which will also handle framework-specific instrumentation out of the box for
you - no need to pass a custom `routingInstrumentation` anymore. For `@sentry/react`, we expose dedicated integrations
for the different react-router versions:

- `reactRouterV6BrowserTracingIntegration()`
- `reactRouterV5BrowserTracingIntegration()`
- `reactRouterV4BrowserTracingIntegration()`
- `reactRouterV3BrowserTracingIntegration()`

See the
[migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md#depreacted-browsertracing-integration)
for details.

#### Cron Monitoring Support for `cron` and `node-cron` libraries

- feat(node): Instrumentation for `cron` library (#9999)
- feat(node): Instrumentation for `node-cron` library (#9904)

This release adds instrumentation for the `cron` and `node-cron` libraries. This allows you to monitor your cron jobs
with [Sentry cron monitors](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/).

For [`cron`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron):

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';
import { CronJob } from 'cron';

const CronJobWithCheckIn = Sentry.cron.instrumentCron(CronJob, 'my-cron-job');

// use the constructor
const job = new CronJobWithCheckIn('* * * * *', () => {
  console.log('You will see this message every minute');
});

// or from
const job = CronJobWithCheckIn.from({
  cronTime: '* * * * *',
  onTick: () => {
    console.log('You will see this message every minute');
  },
});
```

For [`node-cron`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron):

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';
import cron from 'node-cron';

const cronWithCheckIn = Sentry.cron.instrumentNodeCron(cron);

cronWithCheckIn.schedule(
  '* * * * *',
  () => {
    console.log('running a task every minute');
  },
  { name: 'my-cron-job' },
);
```

## 7.91.0

### Important Changes

- **feat: Add server runtime metrics aggregator (#9894)**

The release adds alpha support for [Sentry developer metrics](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/58584) in
the server runtime SDKs (`@sentry/node`, `@sentry/deno`, `@sentry/nextjs` server-side, etc.). Via the newly introduced
APIs, you can now flush metrics directly to Sentry.

To enable capturing metrics, you first need to add the `metricsAggregator` experiment to your `Sentry.init` call.

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '__DSN__',
  _experiments: {
    metricsAggregator: true,
  },
});
```

Then you'll be able to add `counters`, `sets`, `distributions`, and `gauges` under the `Sentry.metrics` namespace.

```js
// Add 4 to a counter named `hits`
Sentry.metrics.increment('hits', 4);

// Add 2 to gauge named `parallel_requests`, tagged with `type: "a"`
Sentry.metrics.gauge('parallel_requests', 2, { tags: { type: 'a' } });

// Add 4.6 to a distribution named `response_time` with unit seconds
Sentry.metrics.distribution('response_time', 4.6, { unit: 'seconds' });

// Add 2 to a set named `valuable.ids`
Sentry.metrics.set('valuable.ids', 2);
```

- **feat(node): Rework ANR to use worker script via an integration (#9945)**

The [ANR tracking integration for Node](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/node/configuration/application-not-responding/)
has been reworked to use an integration. ANR tracking now requires a minimum Node version of 16 or higher. Previously
you had to call `Sentry.enableANRDetection` before running your application, now you can simply add the `Anr`
integration to your `Sentry.init` call.

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'https://public@dsn.ingest.sentry.io/1337',
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Anr({ captureStackTrace: true, anrThreshold: 200 })],
});
```

### Other Changes

- feat(utils): Add function to extract relevant component name (#9921)
- fix(core): Rethrow caught promise rejections in `startSpan`, `startSpanManual`, `trace` (#9958)

## 7.90.0

- feat(replay): Change to use preset quality values (#9903)
- fix(replay): Adjust development hydration error messages (#9922)
- fix(sveltekit): Add `types` field to package.json `exports` (#9926)

## 7.89.0

### Important Changes

#### Deprecations

- **feat(core): Deprecate `configureScope` (#9887)**
- **feat(core): Deprecate `pushScope` & `popScope` (#9890)**

This release deprecates `configureScope`, `pushScope`, and `popScope`, which will be removed in the upcoming v8 major
release.

#### Hapi Integration

- **feat(node): Add Hapi Integration (#9539)**

This release adds an integration for Hapi. It can be used as follows:

```ts
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');
const Hapi = require('@hapi/hapi');

const init = async () => {
  const server = Hapi.server({
    // your server configuration ...
  });

  Sentry.init({
    dsn: '__DSN__',
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
    integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Hapi({ server })],
  });

  server.route({
    // your route configuration ...
  });

  await server.start();
};
```

#### SvelteKit 2.0

- **chore(sveltekit): Add SvelteKit 2.0 to peer dependencies (#9861)**

This release adds support for SvelteKit 2.0 in the `@sentry/sveltekit` package. If you're upgrading from SvelteKit 1.x
to 2.x and already use the Sentry SvelteKit SDK, no changes apart from upgrading to this (or a newer) version are
necessary.

### Other Changes

- feat(core): Add type & utility for function-based integrations (#9818)
- feat(core): Update `withScope` to return callback return value (#9866)
- feat(deno): Support `Deno.CronSchedule` for cron jobs (#9880)

- ref: Use `addBreadcrumb` directly & allow to pass hint (#9867)

Work in this release contributed by @adam187, and @jghinestrosa. Thank you for your contributions!

## 7.88.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(browser): Add browser metrics sdk (#9794)**

The release adds alpha support for [Sentry developer metrics](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/58584) in
the Browser SDKs (`@sentry/browser` and related framework SDKs). Via the newly introduced APIs, you can now flush
metrics directly to Sentry.

To enable capturing metrics, you first need to add the `MetricsAggregator` integration.

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '__DSN__',
  integrations: [new Sentry.metrics.MetricsAggregator()],
});
```

Then you'll be able to add `counters`, `sets`, `distributions`, and `gauges` under the `Sentry.metrics` namespace.

```js
// Add 4 to a counter named `hits`
Sentry.metrics.increment('hits', 4);

// Add 2 to gauge named `parallel_requests`, tagged with `happy: "no"`
Sentry.metrics.gauge('parallel_requests', 2, { tags: { happy: 'no' } });

// Add 4.6 to a distribution named `response_time` with unit seconds
Sentry.metrics.distribution('response_time', 4.6, { unit: 'seconds' });

// Add 2 to a set named `valuable.ids`
Sentry.metrics.set('valuable.ids', 2);
```

In a future release we'll add support for server runtimes (Node, Deno, Bun, Vercel Edge, etc.)

- **feat(deno): Optionally instrument `Deno.cron` (#9808)**

This releases add support for instrumenting [Deno cron's](https://deno.com/blog/cron) with
[Sentry cron monitors](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/). This requires v1.38 of Deno run with the `--unstable`
flag and the usage of the `DenoCron` Sentry integration.

```ts
// Import from the Deno registry
import * as Sentry from 'https://deno.land/x/sentry/index.mjs';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '__DSN__',
  integrations: [new Sentry.DenoCron()],
});
```

## 7.84.0

### Important Changes

- **ref(nextjs): Set `automaticVercelMonitors` to be `false` by default (#9697)**

From this version onwards the default for the `automaticVercelMonitors` option in the Next.js SDK is set to false.
Previously, if you made use of Vercel Crons the SDK automatically instrumented the relevant routes to create Sentry
monitors. Because this feature will soon be generally available, we are now flipping the default to avoid situations
where quota is used unexpectedly.

If you want to continue using this feature, make sure to set the `automaticVercelMonitors` flag to `true` in your
`next.config.js` Sentry settings.

contributions!

## 7.81.0

### Important Changes

**- feat(nextjs): Add instrumentation utility for server actions (#9553)**

This release adds a utility function `withServerActionInstrumentation` to the `@sentry/nextjs` SDK for instrumenting
your Next.js server actions with error and performance monitoring.

You can optionally pass form data and headers to record them, and configure the wrapper to record the Server Action
responses:

```tsx
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';
import { headers } from 'next/headers';

export default function ServerComponent() {
  async function myServerAction(formData: FormData) {
    'use server';
    return await Sentry.withServerActionInstrumentation(
      'myServerAction', // The name you want to associate this Server Action with in Sentry
      {
        formData, // Optionally pass in the form data
        headers: headers(), // Optionally pass in headers
        recordResponse: true, // Optionally record the server action response
      },
      async () => {
        // ... Your Server Action code

        return { name: 'John Doe' };
      },
    );
  }

  return (
    <form action={myServerAction}>
      <input type="text" name="some-input-value" />
      <button type="submit">Run Action</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Important Changes

- **Replay Bundle Size improvements**

We've dramatically decreased the bundle size of our Replay package, reducing the minified & gzipped bundle size by ~20
KB! This was possible by extensive use of tree shaking and a host of small changes to reduce our footprint:

- feat(replay): Update rrweb to 2.2.0 (#9414)
- ref(replay): Use fflate instead of pako for compression (#9436)

By using [tree shaking](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/tree-shaking/) it is possible to shave
up to 10 additional KB off the bundle.

## 7.76.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(core): Add cron monitor wrapper helper (#9395)**

This release adds `Sentry.withMonitor()`, a wrapping function that wraps a callback with a cron monitor that will
automatically report completions and failures:

```ts
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

// withMonitor() will send checkin when callback is started/finished
// works with async and sync callbacks.
const result = Sentry.withMonitor(
  'dailyEmail',
  () => {
    // withCheckIn return value is same return value here
    return sendEmail();
  },
  // Optional upsert options
  {
    schedule: {
      type: 'crontab',
      value: '0 * * * *',
    },
    // ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ðŸ«¡
    timezone: 'Canada/Eastern',
  },
);
```

## 7.75.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(opentelemetry): Add new `@sentry/opentelemetry` package (#9238)**

This release publishes a new package, `@sentry/opentelemetry`. This is a runtime agnostic replacement for
`@sentry/opentelemetry-node` and exports a couple of useful utilities which can be used to use Sentry together with
OpenTelemetry.

You can read more about
[@sentry/opentelemetry in the Readme](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/develop/packages/opentelemetry).

- **feat(replay): Allow to treeshake rrweb features (#9274)**

Starting with this release, you can configure the following build-time flags in order to reduce the SDK bundle size:

- `__RRWEB_EXCLUDE_CANVAS__`
- `__RRWEB_EXCLUDE_IFRAME__`
- `__RRWEB_EXCLUDE_SHADOW_DOM__`

You can read more about
[tree shaking in our docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/tree-shaking/).

## 7.74.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(astro): Add `sentryAstro` integration (#9218)**

This Release introduces the first alpha version of our new SDK for Astro. At this time, the SDK is considered
experimental and things might break and change in future versions.

The core of the SDK is an Astro integration which you easily add to your Astro config:

```js
// astro.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import sentry from '@sentry/astro';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    sentry({
      dsn: '__DSN__',
      sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
        project: 'astro',
        authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

Check out the [README](./packages/astro/README.md) for usage instructions and what to expect from this alpha release.

## 7.73.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(replay): Upgrade to rrweb2**

This is fully backwards compatible with prior versions of the Replay SDK. The only breaking change that we will making
is to not be masking `aria-label` by default. The reason for this change is to align with our core SDK which also does
not mask `aria-label`. This change also enables better support of searching by clicks.

Another change that needs to be highlighted is the 13% bundle size increase. This bundle size increase is necessary to
bring improved recording performance and improved replay fidelity, especially in regards to web components and iframes.
We will be investigating the reduction of the bundle size in
[this PR](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/8815).

Here are benchmarks comparing the version 1 of rrweb to version 2

## 7.72.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(node): App Not Responding with stack traces (#9079)**

This release introduces support for Application Not Responding (ANR) errors for Node.js applications. These errors are
triggered when the Node.js main thread event loop of an application is blocked for more than five seconds. The Node SDK
reports ANR errors as Sentry events and can optionally attach a stacktrace of the blocking code to the ANR event.

To enable ANR detection, import and use the `enableANRDetection` function from the `@sentry/node` package before you run
the rest of your application code. Any event loop blocking before calling `enableANRDetection` will not be detected by
the SDK.

Example (ESM):

```ts
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

await Sentry.enableANRDetection({ captureStackTrace: true });
// Function that runs your app
runApp();
```

Example (CJS):

```ts
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

Sentry.enableANRDetection({ captureStackTrace: true }).then(() => {
  // Function that runs your app
  runApp();
});
```

our Next.js SDK.

## 7.69.0

### Important Changes

- **New Performance APIs**
  - feat: Update span performance API names (#8971)
  - feat(core): Introduce startSpanManual (#8913)

This release introduces a new set of top level APIs for the Performance Monitoring SDKs. These aim to simplify creating
spans and reduce the boilerplate needed for performance instrumentation. The three new methods introduced are
`Sentry.startSpan`, `Sentry.startInactiveSpan`, and `Sentry.startSpanManual`. These methods are available in the browser
and node SDKs.

`Sentry.startSpan` wraps a callback in a span. The span is automatically finished when the callback returns. This is the
recommended way to create spans.

```js
// Start a span that tracks the duration of expensiveFunction
const result = Sentry.startSpan({ name: 'important function' }, () => {
  return expensiveFunction();
});

// You can also mutate the span wrapping the callback to set data or status
Sentry.startSpan({ name: 'important function' }, span => {
  // span is undefined if performance monitoring is turned off or if
  // the span was not sampled. This is done to reduce overhead.
  span?.setData('version', '1.0.0');
  return expensiveFunction();
});
```

If you don't want the span to finish when the callback returns, use `Sentry.startSpanManual` to control when the span is
finished. This is useful for event emitters or similar.

```js
// Start a span that tracks the duration of middleware
function middleware(_req, res, next) {
  return Sentry.startSpanManual({ name: 'middleware' }, (span, finish) => {
    res.once('finish', () => {
      setHttpStatus(span, res.status);
      finish();
    });
    return next();
  });
}
```

`Sentry.startSpan` and `Sentry.startSpanManual` create a span and make it active for the duration of the callback. Any
spans created while this active span is running will be added as a child span to it. If you want to create a span
without making it active, use `Sentry.startInactiveSpan`. This is useful for creating parallel spans that are not
related to each other.

```js
const span1 = Sentry.startInactiveSpan({ name: 'span1' });

someWork();

const span2 = Sentry.startInactiveSpan({ name: 'span2' });

moreWork();

const span3 = Sentry.startInactiveSpan({ name: 'span3' });

evenMoreWork();

span1?.finish();
span2?.finish();
span3?.finish();
```

## 7.67.0

### Important Changes

- **feat: Mark errors caught by the SDK as unhandled**
  - feat(browser): Mark errors caught from `TryCatch` integration as unhandled (#8890)
  - feat(integrations): Mark errors caught from `HttpClient` and `CaptureConsole` integrations as unhandled (#8891)
  - feat(nextjs): Mark errors caught from NextJS wrappers as unhandled (#8893)
  - feat(react): Mark errors captured from ErrorBoundary as unhandled (#8914)
  - feat(remix): Add debugid injection and map deletion to sourcemaps script (#8814)
  - feat(remix): Mark errors caught from Remix instrumentation as unhandled (#8894)
  - feat(serverless): Mark errors caught in Serverless handlers as unhandled (#8907)
  - feat(vue): Mark errors caught by Vue wrappers as unhandled (#8905)

This release fixes inconsistent behaviour of when our SDKs classify captured errors as unhandled. Previously, some of
our instrumentations correctly set unhandled, while others set handled. Going forward, all errors caught automatically
from our SDKs will be marked as unhandled. If you manually capture errors (e.g. by calling `Sentry.captureException`),
your errors will continue to be reported as handled.

This change might lead to a decrease in reported crash-free sessions and consequently in your release health score. If
you have concerns about this, feel free to open an issue.

## 7.62.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(integrations): Add `ContextLines` integration for html-embedded JS stack frames (#8699)**

This release adds the `ContextLines` integration as an optional integration for the Browser SDKs to
`@sentry/integrations`.

This integration adds source code from inline JavaScript of the current page's HTML (e.g. JS in `<script>` tags) to
stack traces of captured errors. It _can't_ collect source code from assets referenced by your HTML (e.g.
`<script src="..." />`).

The `ContextLines` integration is useful when you have inline JS code in HTML pages that can't be accessed by Sentry's
backend, for example, due to a login-protected page.

```js
import { ContextLines } from '@sentry/integrations';

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    new ContextLines({
      // The number of lines to collect before and after each stack frame's line number
      // Defaults to 7
      frameContextLines: 7,
    }),
  ],
});
```

## 7.61.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(node-experimental): Add `@sentry/node-experimental` package as MVP for POTEL (#8609)**

This introduces a new, _experimental_ package, `@sentry/node-experimental`. This is a variant of the Node SDK which uses
OpenTelemetry under the hood for performance instrumentation.

Note that this package is very much WIP, considered unstable and may change at any time. **No SemVer guarantees apply
whatsoever.** Still, if you're brave enough you can give it a try.
[Read more about @sentry/node-experimental](./packages/node-experimental/README.md)

### Other Changes

- fix(node): Don't set extra baggage headers (#8657)
- fix(tracing): Trim idle transaction spans if they exceed final timeout (#8653)

## 7.60.1

- fix(nextjs): Match folder paths with trailing separator (#8615)
- fix(replay): Ignore clicks with `shift` pressed (#8648)
- fix(replay): Use `session.started` for min/max duration check (#8617)

## 7.60.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(replay): Ensure min/max duration when flushing (#8596)**

We will not send replays that are <5s long anymore. Additionally, we also added further safeguards to avoid overly long
(>1h) replays. You can optionally configure the min. replay duration (defaults to 5s):

```js
new Replay({
  minReplayDuration: 10000, // in ms - note that this is capped at 15s max!
});
```

### Important Changes

- **- feat(remix): Add Remix v2 support (#8415)**

This release adds support for Remix v2 future flags, in particular for new error handling utilities of Remix v2. We
heavily recommend you switch to using `v2_errorBoundary` future flag to get the best error handling experience with
Sentry.

To capture errors from [v2 client-side ErrorBoundary](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/error-boundary-v2), you
should define your own `ErrorBoundary` in `root.tsx` and use `Sentry.captureRemixErrorBoundaryError` helper to capture
the error.

```typescript
// root.tsx
import { captureRemixErrorBoundaryError } from "@sentry/remix";

export const ErrorBoundary: V2_ErrorBoundaryComponent = () => {
  const error = useRouteError();

  captureRemixErrorBoundaryError(error);

  return <div> ... </div>;
};
```

For server-side errors, define a
[`handleError`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/entry.server#handleerror) function in your server entry
point and use the `Sentry.captureRemixServerException` helper to capture the error.

```ts
// entry.server.tsx
export function handleError(error: unknown, { request }: DataFunctionArgs): void {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    Sentry.captureRemixServerException(error, 'remix.server', request);
  } else {
    // Optionally capture non-Error objects
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  }
}
```

For more details, see the Sentry [Remix SDK](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/) documentation.

## 7.58.0

### Important Changes

- **Performance Monitoring not required for Distributed Tracing**

This release adds support for
[distributed tracing](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/usage/distributed-tracing/) without requiring
performance monitoring to be active on the JavaScript SDKs (browser and node). This means even if there is no sampled
transaction/span, the SDK will still propagate traces to downstream services. Distributed Tracing can be configured with
the `tracePropagationTargets` option, which controls what requests to attach the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` HTTP
headers to (which is what propagates tracing information).

```js
Sentry.init({
  tracePropagationTargets: ['third-party-site.com', /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],
});
```

- feat(tracing): Add tracing without performance to browser and client Sveltekit (#8458)
- feat(node): Add tracing without performance to Node http integration (#8450)
- feat(node): Add tracing without performance to Node Undici (#8449)
- feat(node): Populate propagation context using env variables (#8422)

- **feat(core): Support `AggregateErrors` in `LinkedErrors` integration (#8463)**

This release adds support for
[`AggregateErrors`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AggregateError).
AggregateErrors are considered as Exception Groups by Sentry, and will be visualized and grouped differently. See the
[Exception Groups Changelog Post](https://changelog.getsentry.com/announcements/exception-groups-now-supported-for-python-and-net)
for more details.

Exception Group support requires Self-Hosted Sentry
[version 23.5.1](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.5.1) or newer.

- **feat(replay): Add a new option `networkDetailDenyUrls` (#8439)**

This release adds a new option `networkDetailDenyUrls` to the `Replay` integration. This option allows you to specify a
list of URLs that should not be captured by the `Replay` integration, which can be used alongside the existing
`networkDetailAllowUrls` for finely grained control of which URLs should have network details captured.

```js
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.Integrations.Replay({
      networkDetailDenyUrls: [/^http:\/\/example.com\/test$/],
    }),
  ],
});
```

## 7.57.0

### Important Changes

- **build: Update typescript from 3.8.3 to 4.9.5 (#8255)**

This release version
[bumps the internally used typescript version from 3.8.x to 4.9.x](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/8255).
We use ds-downlevel to generate two versions of our types, one for >=3.8, one for >=4.9. This means that this change
should be fully backwards compatible and not have any noticable user impact, but if you still encounter issues please
let us know.

- **feat(types): Add tracePropagationTargets to top level options (#8395)**

Instead of passing `tracePropagationTargets` to the `BrowserTracing` integration, you can now define them on the top
level:

```js
Sentry.init({
  tracePropagationTargets: ['api.site.com'],
});
```

- **fix(angular): Filter out `TryCatch` integration by default (#8367)**

The Angular and Angular-ivy SDKs will not install the TryCatch integration anymore by default. This integration
conflicted with the `SentryErrorHander`, sometimes leading to duplicated errors and/or missing data on events.

- **feat(browser): Better event name handling for non-Error objects (#8374)**

When capturing non-errors via `Sentry.captureException()`, e.g. `Sentry.captureException({ prop: "custom object" })`, we
now generate a more helpful value for the synthetic exception. Instead of e.g.
`Non-Error exception captured with keys: currentTarget, isTrusted, target, type`, you'll now get messages like:

```
Object captured as exception with keys: prop1, prop2
Event `MouseEvent` (type=click) captured as exception
Event `ErrorEvent` captured as exception with message `Script error.`
```

## 7.54.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(core): Add default entries to `ignoreTransactions` for Healthchecks #8191**

  All SDKs now filter out health check transactions by default. These are transactions where the transaction name
  matches typical API health check calls, such as `/^.*healthy.*$/` or `/^.  *heartbeat.*$/`. Take a look at
  [this list](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/8c6ad156829f7c4eec34e4a67e6dd866ba482d5d/packages/core/src/integrations/inboundfilters.ts#L8C2-L16)
  to learn which regexes we currently use to match transaction names. We believe that these transactions do not provide
  value in most cases and we want to save you some of your quota by filtering them out by default. These filters are
  implemented as default values for the top level `ignoreTransactions` option.

  You can disable this filtering by manually specifiying the `InboundFilters` integration and setting the
  `disableTransactionDefaults` option:

  ```js
  Sentry.init({
    //...
    integrations: [new InboundFilters({ disableTransactionDefaults: true })],
  });
  ```

- **feat(replay): Add `mutationBreadcrumbLimit` and `mutationLimit` to Replay Options (#8228)**

  The previously experimental options `mutationBreadcumbLimit` and `mutationLimit` have been promoted to regular Replay
  integration options.

  A high number of DOM mutations (in a single event loop) can cause performance regressions in end-users' browsers. Use
  `mutationBreadcrumbLimit` to send a breadcrumb along with your recording if the mutation limit was reached. Use
  `mutationLimit` to stop recording if the mutation limit was reached.

- **feat(sveltekit): Add source maps support for Vercel (lambda) (#8256)**

  - feat(sveltekit): Auto-detect SvelteKit adapters (#8193)

  The SvelteKit SDK can now be used if you deploy your SvelteKit app to Vercel. By default, the SDK's Vite plugin will
  detect the used adapter and adjust the source map uploading config as necessary. If you want to override the default
  adapter detection, you can specify the `adapter` option in the `sentrySvelteKit` options:

  ```js
  // vite.config.js
  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
      sentrySvelteKit({
        adapter: 'vercel',
      }),
      sveltekit(),
    ],
  });
  ```

  Currently, the Vite plugin will configure itself correctly for `@sveltejs/adapter-auto`, `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel`
  and `@sveltejs/adapter-node`.

  **Important:** The SvelteKit SDK is not yet compatible with Vercel's edge runtime. It will only work for lambda
  functions.

### Important Next.js SDK changes:

This release adds support Vercel Cron Jobs in the Next.js SDK. The SDK will automatically create
[Sentry Cron Monitors](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/) for your
[Vercel Cron Jobs](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs) configured via `vercel.json` when deployed on Vercel.

You can opt out of this functionality by setting the `automaticVercelMonitors` option to `false`:

```js
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  sentry: {
    automaticVercelMonitors: false,
  },
};
```

(Note: Sentry Cron Monitoring is currently in beta and subject to change. Help us make it better by letting us know what
you think. Respond on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/42283) or write to us at
crons-feedback@sentry.io)

- feat(nextjs): Add API method to wrap API routes with crons instrumentation (#8084)
- feat(nextjs): Add automatic monitors for Vercel Cron Jobs (#8088)

### Other changes

**Replay `rrweb` changes:**

`@sentry-internal/rrweb` was updated from 1.106.0 to 1.108.0:

- fix: Fix some input masking (esp for radio buttons) ([#85](https://github.com/getsentry/rrweb/pull/85))
- fix: Unescaped `:` in CSS rule from Safari ([#86](https://github.com/getsentry/rrweb/pull/86))
- feat: Define custom elements (web components) ([#87](https://github.com/getsentry/rrweb/pull/87))

Work in this release contributed by @sreetamdas. Thank you for your contribution!

## 7.51.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(sveltekit): Auto-wrap `load` functions with proxy module (#7994)**

`@sentry/sveltekit` now auto-wraps `load` functions in

- `+(page|layout).(ts|js)` files (universal loads)
- `+(page|layout).server.(ts|js)` files (server-only loads)

This means that you don't have to manually add the `wrapLoadWithSentry` and `wrapServerLoadWithSentry` functions around
your load functions. The SDK will not interfere with already wrapped `load` functions.

For more details, take a look at the
[Readme](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/packages/sveltekit/README.md#configure-auto-instrumentation)

- **chore(angular): Upgrade `peerDependencies` to Angular 16 (#8035)**

We now officially support Angular 16 in `@sentry/angular-ivy`. Note that `@sentry/angular` _does not_ support
Angular 16.

- **feat(node): Add ability to send cron monitor check ins (#8039)**

**Note: This release contains a bug with generating cron monitors. We recommend you upgrade the JS SDK to 7.51.1 or
above to use cron monitoring functionality**

This release adds [Sentry cron monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/) support to the Node SDK.

Check-in monitoring allows you to track a job's progress by completing two check-ins: one at the start of your job and
another at the end of your job. This two-step process allows Sentry to notify you if your job didn't start when expected
(missed) or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

```ts
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

// ðŸŸ¡ Notify Sentry your job is running:
const checkInId = Sentry.captureCheckIn({
  monitorSlug: '<monitor-slug>',
  status: 'in_progress',
});

// Execute your scheduled task here...

// ðŸŸ¢ Notify Sentry your job has completed successfully:
Sentry.captureCheckIn({
  // make sure you pass in the checkInId generated by the first call to captureCheckIn
  checkInId,
  monitorSlug: '<monitor-slug>',
  status: 'ok',
});
```

If your job execution fails, you can notify Sentry about the failure:

```javascript
// ðŸ”´ Notify Sentry your job has failed:
Sentry.captureCheckIn({
  checkInId,
  monitorSlug: '<monitor-slug>',
  status: 'error',
});
```

### Additional Features and Fixes

- feat(browser): Export makeMultiplexedTransport from browser SDK (#8012)
- feat(node): Add `http.method` to node http spans (#7991)
- feat(tracing): add body size for fetch requests (#7935)
- feat(tracing): Use http.method for span data (#7990)
- fix(integrations): Handle windows paths with no prefix or backslash prefix in `RewriteFrames` (#7995)
- fix(node): Mark stack frames with url protocol as in-app frames (#8008)
- fix(remix): Export `Integration` type declaration as union type (#8016)
- fix(replay): Do not add replay_id to DSC while buffering (#8020)
- fix(tracing): Don't set method multiple times (#8014)
- fix(utils): Normalize `undefined` to `undefined` instead of `"[undefined]"` (#8017)

Work in this release contributed by @srubin and @arjenbrandenburgh. Thank you for your contributions!

## 7.50.0

### Important Changes

- **doc(sveltekit): Promote the SDK to beta state (#7976)**
  - feat(sveltekit): Convert `sentryHandle` to a factory function (#7975)

With this release, the Sveltekit SDK ([@sentry/sveltekit](./packages/sveltekit/README.md)) is promoted to Beta. This
means that we do not expect any more breaking changes.

The final breaking change is that `sentryHandle` is now a function. So in order to update to 7.50.0, you have to update
your `hooks.server.js` file:

```js
// hooks.server.js

// Old:
export const handle = sentryHandle;
// New:
export const handle = sentryHandle();
```

- **feat(replay): Allow to configure URLs to capture network bodies/headers (#7953)**

You can now capture request/response bodies & headers of network requests in Replay. You have to define an allowlist of
URLs you want to capture additional information for:

```js
new Replay({
  networkDetailAllowUrls: ['https://sentry.io/api'],
});
```

By default, we will capture request/response bodies, as well as the request/response headers `content-type`,
`content-length` and `accept`. You can configure this with some additional configuration:

```js
new Replay({
  networkDetailAllowUrls: ['https://sentry.io/api'],
  // opt-out of capturing bodies
  networkCaptureBodies: false,
  // These headers are captured _in addition to_ the default headers
  networkRequestHeaders: ['X-Custom-Header'],
  networkResponseHeaders: ['X-Custom-Header', 'X-Custom-Header-2'],
});
```

Note that bodies will be truncated to a max length of ~150k characters.

**- feat(replay): Changes of sampling behavior & public API**

- feat(replay): Change the behavior of error-based sampling (#7768)
- feat(replay): Change `flush()` API to record current event buffer (#7743)
- feat(replay): Change `stop()` to flush and remove current session (#7741)

We have changed the behavior of error-based sampling, as well as adding & adjusting APIs a bit to be more aligned with
expectations. See [Sampling](./packages/replay/README.md#sampling) for details.

We've also revamped some public APIs in order to be better aligned with expectations. See
[Stoping & Starting Replays manually](./packages/replay/README.md#stopping--starting-replays-manually) for details.

- **feat(core): Add multiplexed transport (#7926)**

We added a new transport to support multiplexing. With this, you can configure Sentry to send events to different DSNs,
depending on a logic of your choosing:

```js
import { makeMultiplexedTransport } from '@sentry/core';
import { init, captureException, makeFetchTransport } from '@sentry/browser';

function dsnFromFeature({ getEvent }) {
  const event = getEvent();
  switch (event?.tags?.feature) {
    case 'cart':
      return ['__CART_DSN__'];
    case 'gallery':
      return ['__GALLERY_DSN__'];
  }
  return [];
}

init({
  dsn: '__FALLBACK_DSN__',
  transport: makeMultiplexedTransport(makeFetchTransport, dsnFromFeature),
});
```

### Additional Features and Fixes

- feat(nextjs): Add `disableLogger` option that automatically tree shakes logger statements (#7908)
- feat(node): Make Undici a default integration. (#7967)
- feat(replay): Extend session idle time until expire to 15min (#7955)
- feat(tracing): Add `db.system` span data to DB spans (#7952)
- fix(core): Avoid crash when Function.prototype is frozen (#7899)
- fix(nextjs): Fix inject logic for Next.js 13.3.1 canary (#7921)
- fix(replay): Ensure console breadcrumb args are truncated (#7917)
- fix(replay): Ensure we do not set replayId on dsc if replay is disabled (#7939)
- fix(replay): Ensure we still truncate large bodies if they are failed JSON (#7923)
- fix(utils): default normalize() to a max. of 100 levels deep instead of Inifnity (#7957)

Work in this release contributed by @Jack-Works. Thank you for your contribution!

## 7.49.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(sveltekit): Read adapter output directory from `svelte.config.js` (#7863)**

Our source maps upload plugin is now able to read `svelte.config.js`. This is necessary to automatically find the output
directory that users can specify when setting up the Node adapter.

- **fix(replay): Ensure we normalize scope breadcrumbs to max. depth to avoid circular ref (#7915)**

This release fixes a potential problem with how Replay captures console logs. Any objects logged will now be cut off
after a maximum depth of 10, as well as cutting off any properties after the 1000th. This should ensure we do not
accidentally capture massive console logs, where a stringified object could reach 100MB or more.

- **fix(utils): Normalize HTML elements as string (#7916)**

We used to normalize references to HTML elements as POJOs. This is both not very easily understandable, as well as
potentially large, as HTML elements may have properties attached to them. With this change, we now normalize them to
e.g. `[HTMLElement: HTMLInputElement]`.

### Additional Features and Fixes

- feat(browser): Simplify stack parsers (#7897)
- feat(node): Add monitor upsert types (#7914)
- feat(replay): Truncate network bodies to max size (#7875)
- fix(gatsby): Don't crash build when auth token is missing (#7858)
- fix(gatsby): Use `import` for `gatsby-browser.js` instead of `require` (#7889)
- fix(nextjs): Handle braces in stack frame URLs (#7900)

- fix(sveltekit): Avoid capturing "Not Found" errors in server `handleError` wrapper (#7898)
- fix(sveltekit): Detect sentry release before creating the Vite plugins (#7902)
- fix(sveltekit): Use `sentry.properties` file when uploading source maps (#7890)
- fix(tracing): Ensure we use s instead of ms for startTimestamp (#7877)
- ref(deprecate): Deprecate `timestampWithMs` (#7878)
- ref(nextjs): Don't use Sentry Webpack Plugin in dev mode (#7901)

## 7.48.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(node): Add `AsyncLocalStorage` implementation of `AsyncContextStrategy` (#7800)**
  - feat(core): Extend `AsyncContextStrategy` to allow reuse of existing context (#7778)
  - feat(core): Make `runWithAsyncContext` public API (#7817)
  - feat(core): Add async context abstraction (#7753)
  - feat(node): Adds `domain` implementation of `AsyncContextStrategy` (#7767)
  - feat(node): Auto-select best `AsyncContextStrategy` for Node.js version (#7804)
  - feat(node): Migrate to domains used through `AsyncContextStrategy` (#7779)

This release switches the SDK to use
[`AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) as the async context isolation
mechanism in the SDK for Node 14+. For Node 10 - 13, we continue to use the Node
[`domain`](https://nodejs.org/api/domain.html) standard library, since `AsyncLocalStorage` is not supported there.
**Preliminary testing showed
[a 30% improvement in latency and rps](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/7691#issuecomment-1504009089)
when making the switch from domains to `AsyncLocalStorage` on Node 16.**

If you want to manually add async context isolation to your application, you can use the new `runWithAsyncContext` API.

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

const requestHandler = (ctx, next) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    Sentry.runWithAsyncContext(async () => {
      const hub = Sentry.getCurrentHub();

      hub.configureScope(scope =>
        scope.addEventProcessor(event =>
          Sentry.addRequestDataToEvent(event, ctx.request, {
            include: {
              user: false,
            },
          }),
        ),
      );

      try {
        await next();
      } catch (err) {
        reject(err);
      }
      resolve();
    });
  });
};
```

If you're manually using domains to isolate Sentry data, we strongly recommend switching to this API!

In addition to exporting `runWithAsyncContext` publicly, the SDK also uses it internally where we previously used
domains.

- **feat(sveltekit): Remove `withSentryViteConfig` (#7789)**
  - feat(sveltekit): Remove SDK initialization via dedicated files (#7791)

This release removes our `withSentryViteConfig` wrapper we previously instructed you to add to your `vite.config.js`
file. It is replaced Vite plugins which you simply add to your Vite config, just like the `sveltekit()` Vite plugins. We
believe this is a more transparent and Vite/SvelteKit-native way of applying build time modifications. Here's how to use
the plugins:

```js
// vite.config.js
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';
import { sentrySvelteKit } from '@sentry/sveltekit';

export default {
  plugins: [sentrySvelteKit(), sveltekit()],
  // ... rest of your Vite config
};
```

Take a look at the [`README`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/packages/sveltekit/README.md)
for updated instructions!

Furthermore, with this transition, we removed the possibility to intialize the SDK in dedicated
`sentry.(client|server).config.js` files. Please use SvelteKit's
[hooks files](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/packages/sveltekit/README.md#2-client-side-setup)
to initialize the SDK.

Please note that these are **breaking changes**! We're sorry for the inconvenience but the SvelteKit SDK is still in
alpha stage and we want to establish a clean and SvelteKit-friendly API before making the SDK stable. You have been
[warned](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/eb921275f9c572e72c2348a91cb39fcbb8275b8d/packages/sveltekit/README.md#L20-L24)
;)

- **feat(sveltekit): Add Sentry Vite Plugin to upload source maps (#7811)**

This release adds automatic upload of source maps to the SvelteKit SDK. No need to configure anything other than adding
our Vite plugins to your SDK. The example above shows you how to do this.

Please make sure to follow the
[`README`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/packages/sveltekit/README.md#uploading-source-maps)
to specify your Sentry auth token, as well as org and project slugs.

**- feat(replay): Capture request & response headers (#7816)**

Replay now captures the `content-length`, `content-type`, and `accept` headers from requests and responses
automatically.

## 7.47.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(browser)**: Add captureUserFeedback (#7729)

This release adds a new API, `Sentry.captureUserFeedback`, to browser-side SDKs that allows you to send user feedback to
Sentry without loading and opening Sentry's user feedback dialog. This allows you to obtain user feedback however and
whenever you want to and simply send it to Sentry using the SDK.

For instance, you can collect feedback, whenever convenient as shown in this example:

```js
const eventId = Sentry.captureMessage('User Feedback');
const user = Sentry.getCurrentHub().getScope().getUser();
const userFeedback = {
  event_id: eventId;
  email: user.email
  name: user.username
  comments: 'I really like your App, thanks!'
}
Sentry.captureUserFeedback(userFeedback);
```

Note that feedback needs to be coupled to an event but as in the example above, you can just use `Sentry.captureMessage`
to generate one.

You could also collect feedback in a custom way if an error happens and use the SDK to send it along:

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '__DSN__',
  beforeSend: event => {
    const userFeedback = collectYourUserFeedback();
    const feedback = {
      ...userFeedback,
      event_id: event.event_id.
    }
    Sentry.captureUserFeedback(feedback);
    return event;
  }
})
```

- **feat(tracing)**: Deprecate `@sentry/tracing` exports (#7611)

With this release, we officially deprecate all exports from the `@sentry/tracing` package, in favour of using them
directly from the main SDK package. The `@sentry/tracing` package will be removed in a future major release.

Please take a look at the [Migration docs](./MIGRATION.md/#remove-requirement-for-sentrytracing-package-since-7460) for
more details.

### Additional Features and Fixes

## 7.46.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(sveltekit)**: Add Performance Monitoring for SvelteKit
  - feat(sveltekit): Add meta tag for backend -> frontend (#7574)
  - fix(sveltekit): Explicitly export Node SDK exports (#7644)
  - fix(sveltekit): Handle nested server calls in `sentryHandle` (#7598)
  - ref(sveltekit): Split up universal and server load wrappers (#7652)

This release adds support for Performance Monitoring in our SvelteKit SDK for the client/server. We've also changed how
you should initialize your SDK. Please read our updated [SvelteKit README instructions](./packages/sveltekit/README.md)
for more details.

- **feat(core)**: Add `ignoreTransactions` option (#7594)

You can now easily filter out certain transactions from being sent to Sentry based on their name.

```ts
Sentry.init({
  ignoreTransactions: ['/api/healthcheck', '/ping'],
});
```

- **feat(node)**: Undici integration (#7582)
  - feat(nextjs): Add Undici integration automatically (#7648)
  - feat(sveltekit): Add Undici integration by default (#7650)

We've added an integration that automatically instruments [Undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici) and Node server
side fetch. This supports Undici `v4.7.0` or higher and requires Node `v16.7.0` or higher. After adding the integration
outgoing requests made by Undici will have associated spans and breadcrumbs in Sentry.

```ts
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Undici()],
});
```

In our Next.js and SvelteKit SDKs, this integration is automatically added.

- **feat(node)**: Add Sentry tRPC middleware (#7511)

We've added a new middleware for [trpc](https://trpc.io/) that automatically adds TRPC information to Sentry
transactions. This middleware is meant to be used in combination with a Sentry server integration (Next.js, Express,
etc).

```ts
import { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

const t = initTRPC.context().create();
const sentryMiddleware = t.middleware(
  Sentry.Handlers.trpcMiddleware({
    attachRpcInput: true,
  }),
);

const sentrifiedProcedure = t.procedure.use(sentryMiddleware);
```

- **feat(tracing)**: Remove requirement for `@sentry/tracing` package

With `7.46.0` you no longer require the `@sentry/tracing` package to use tracing and performance monitoring with the
Sentry JavaScript SDKs. The `@sentry/tracing` package will be removed in a future major release, but can still be used
with no changes.

Please see the [Migration docs](./MIGRATION.md/#remove-requirement-for-sentrytracing-package-since-7460) for more
details.

- **fix(node)**: Convert debugging code to callbacks to fix memory leak in `LocalVariables` integration (#7637)

This fixes a memory leak in the opt-in
[`LocalVariables` integration](https://blog.sentry.io/2023/02/01/local-variables-for-nodejs-in-sentry/), which adds
local variables to the stacktraces sent to Sentry. The minimum recommended version to use the `LocalVariables` is now
`7.46.0`.

### Additional Features and Fixes

- feat(node): Auto discovery only returns integrations where dependency loads (#7603)
- feat(node): Sanitize URLs in Span descriptions and breadcrumbs (PII) (#7667)

## 7.31.1

- build(replay): Provide full browser+tracing+replay bundle (#6793)
- feat(nextjs): Disable NextJS perf monitoring when using otel (#6820)
- fix(nextjs): Add back browser field in package.json (#6809)
- fix(nextjs): Connect Edge API route errors to span (#6806)
- fix(nextjs): Correctly handle ts middleware files (#6816)

## 7.31.0

The Next.js SDK now supports error and performance monitoring for Next.js
[middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware) and
[Edge API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/edge-api-routes). To set it up, add a `sentry.edge.config.js` or
`sentry.edge.config.ts` file to the root of your project and initialize the SDK:

```js
// sentry.edge.config.js or sentry.edge.config.ts

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';

const SENTRY_DSN = process.env.SENTRY_DSN || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN;

Sentry.init({
  dsn: SENTRY_DSN || 'YOUR DSN HERE',
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

The Next.js will automatically instrument Edge API routes and middleware. If you want to opt out of automatic
instrumentation of middleware can use the `autoInstrumentMiddleware` option in the `sentry` object of your Next.js
configuration:

```javascript
const moduleExports = {
  sentry: {
    autoInstrumentMiddleware: false,
  },
};
```

Middleware can be manually instrumented by using the `wrapMiddlewareWithSentry` function.

## 7.29.0

This update includes a change to the `@sentry/nextjs` SDK that may increase response times of requests in applications
deployed to Vercel or AWS lambdas to ensure that error events are sent consistently. Additionally, Next.js applications

## 7.24.0

This release bumps the
[`@sentry/replay`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/replay/README.md) package from
version 0.x to 7.24.0. Along with this version bump, we're introducing a few breaking changes. Take a look at the
[Replay migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/replay/MIGRATION.md) for
further information. The Replay version bump is the result of moving the package into the Sentry JavaScript SDK monorepo
which aligns the version with our other JS SDK packages. **Important:** If you're using Replay with version 7.24.x or
newer, make sure to also upgrade your other `@sentry/*` packages to this version.

alpha release to integrate OpenTelemetry performance tracing with Sentry. Give it a try and let us know if you have any
feedback or problems with using it. (#6000)

This release also deprecates the `tracingOrigins` option in favor of using `shouldCreateSpanForRequest` and
`tracePropagationTargets`. See [#6176](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/6176) for details.

## 7.17.1

This release standardizes our SDKs to use the MIT License, which is our
[standard license for Sentry SDKs](https://open.sentry.io/licensing/). We were previously using the BSD 3-Clause License
in `@sentry/browser`,`@sentry/core`, `@sentry/gatsby`, `@sentry/hub`, `@sentry/integrations`, `@sentry/node`,
`@sentry/react`, `@sentry/types`, `@sentry/typescript`, and `@sentry/utils`.

This release also updates the behaviour of
[`tracingOrigins`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#tracingorigins)
to no longer affect span creation. `tracingOrigins` will only affect if `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers are
attached to outgoing requests. To control span creation, use the
[`shouldCreateSpanForRequest`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#shouldcreatespanforrequest)
option.

## 7.12.0

This release adds an environment check in `@sentry/nextjs` for Vercel deployments (using the `VERCEL_ENV` env variable),
and only enables `SentryWebpackPlugin` if the environment is `production`. To override this,
[setting `disableClientWebpackPlugin` or `disableServerWebpackPlugin` to `false`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/#disable-sentrywebpackplugin)
now takes precedence over other checks, rather than being a no-op. Note: Overriding this is not recommended! It can
increase build time and clog Release Health data in Sentry with inaccurate noise.

the SDK code to the same transpilation level as the user code. By specifying this option, the Next.JS SDK works in older
browsers that do not support ES6 or ES6+ (e.g. object spread) features.

## 7.5.1

This release removes the `user_id` and the `transaction` field from the dynamic sampling context data that is attached
to outgoing requests as well as sent to Relay.

- ref(tracing): Remove transaction name and user_id from DSC (#5363)

## 7.5.0

This release adds the `sendDefaultPii` flag to the `Sentry.init` options. When using performance monitoring capabilities
of the SDK, it controls whether user IDs (set via `Sentry.setUser`) are propagated in the `baggage` header of outgoing
HTTP requests. This flag is set to `false` per default, and acts as an opt-in mechanism for sending potentially
sensitive data. If you want to attach user IDs to Sentry transactions and traces, set this flag to `true` but keep in
mind that this is potentially sensitive information.

- feat(sdk): Add sendDefaultPii option to the JS SDKs (#5341)
- fix(remix): Sourcemaps upload script is missing in the tarball (#5356)
- fix(remix): Use cjs for main entry point (#5352)

please see the [README](./packages/remix/README.md) and
[the tracking GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/4894).

Attention: Due to an oversight, the `@sentry/remix` package is only published as part of the `7.4.1` release.

## 7.0.0

Version 7 of the Sentry JavaScript SDK brings a variety of features and fixes including bundle size and performance
improvements, brand new integrations, support for the attachments API, and key bug fixes.

This release does not change or remove any top level public API methods (`captureException`, `captureMessage`), and only
requires changes to certain configuration options or custom clients/integrations/transports.

**Note: The v7 version of the JavaScript SDK requires a self-hosted version of Sentry 20.6.0 or higher. If you are using
a version of [self-hosted Sentry](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/) (aka onpremise) older than `20.6.0` then you
will need to [upgrade](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/releases/).**

For detailed overview of all the changes, please see our [v7 migration guide](./MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6x-to-7x).

### Breaking Changes

If you are a regular consumer of the Sentry JavaScript SDK you only need to focus on the general items. The internal
breaking changes are aimed at libraries that build on top of and extend the JavaScript SDK (like
[`@sentry/electron`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-electron/) or
[`@sentry/react-native`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/)).

#### General

- [Updated CommonJS distributions to use ES6 by default](./MIGRATION.md#moving-to-es6-for-commonjs-files). If you need
  to support Internet Explorer 11 or old Node.js versions, we recommend using a preprocessing tool like
  [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to convert Sentry packages to ES5. (#5005)
- Default `bundle.min.js` to ES6 instead of ES5.
  [ES5 bundles are still available at `bundle.es5.min.js`](./MIGRATION.md#renaming-of-cdn-bundles). (#4958)
- Updated build system to use TypeScript 3.8.3 (#4895)
- Deprecated `Severity` enum for bundle size reasons.
  [Please use string literals instead](./MIGRATION.md#severity-severitylevel-and-severitylevels). (#4926)
- Removed `critical` Severity level. (#5032)
- `whitelistUrls` and `blacklistUrls` have been renamed to `allowUrls` and `denyUrls` in the `Sentry.init()` options.
  (#4850)
- `BaseClient` and it's child classes now require `transport`, `stackParser`, and `integrations` to be
  [explicitly passed in](./MIGRATION.md#explicit-client-options). This was done to improve tree-shakability. (#4927)
- Updated package distribution structure and stopped distributing CDN bundles through `@sentry/*` npm packages.
  [See details in our migration docs.](./MIGRATION.md#restructuring-of-package-content). (#4900) (#4901)
- [Simplified `Transport` API](./MIGRATION.md#transport-changes). This means
  [custom transports will have to be adjusted accordingly.](./MIGRATION.md#custom-transports).
- Updated how [Node Transport Options are passed down](./MIGRATION.md#node-transport-changes).
- Start propogating [`baggage` HTTP header](https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/) alongside `sentry-trace` header to
  [propogate additional tracing related information.](./MIGRATION.md#propagation-of-baggage-header). (#5133)
- Renamed `registerRequestInstrumentation` export to `instrumentOutgoingRequests` in `@sentry/tracing`. (#4859)
- Renamed `UserAgent` integration to `HttpContext`. (#5027)
- Replaced `BrowserTracing` integration's `maxTransactionDuration` option with `finalTimeout` option in the
  `@sentry/tracing` package and reset `idleTimeout` based on activities count. This should improve accuracy of
  web-vitals like LCP by 20-30%. (#5044)
- [Updated `@sentry/angular` to be compiled by the angular compiler](./MIGRATION.md#sentry-angular-sdk-changes). (#4641)
- Made tracing package treeshakable (#5166)
- Removed support for [Node v6](./MIGRATION.md#dropping-support-for-nodejs-v6). (#4851)
- Removed `@sentry/minimal` package in favour of using [`@sentry/hub`](./MIGRATION.md#removal-of-sentryminimal). (#4971)
- Removed support for Opera browser pre v15 (#4923)
- Removed `ignoreSentryErrors` option from AWS lambda SDK. Errors originating from the SDK will now _always_ be caught
  internally. (#4994)
- Removed `Integrations.BrowserTracing` export from `@sentry/nextjs`. Please import `BrowserTracing` from
  `@sentry/nextjs` directly.
- Removed static `id` property from `BrowserTracing` integration.
- Removed `SDK_NAME` export from `@sentry/browser`, `@sentry/node`, `@sentry/tracing` and `@sentry/vue` packages.
  (#5040)
- Removed `Angular`, `Ember`, and `Vue` integrations from `@sentry/integrations`
  [in favour of the explicit framework packages: `@sentry/angular`, `@sentry/ember`, and `@sentry/vue`](./MIGRATION.md#removal-of-old-platform-integrations-from-sentryintegrations-package).
  (#4893)
- Removed [enums `Status`, `RequestSessionStatus`, and `SessionStatus`.](./MIGRATION.md#removed-enums). Deprecated
  [enums `SpanStatus` and `Severity`](./MIGRATION.md#deprecated-enums). This was done to save on bundle size. (#4891)
  (#4889) (#4890)
- Removed support for deprecated `@sentry/apm` package. (#4845)
- Removed deprecated `user` field from DSN interface. `publicKey` should be used instead. (#4864)
- Removed deprecated `getActiveDomain` method and `DomainAsCarrier` type from `@sentry/hub`. (#4858)
- Removed `eventStatusFromHttpCode` to save on bundle size.
- Removed usage of deprecated `event.stacktrace` field. (#4885)
- Removed raven-node backward-compat code (#4942)
- Removed `showReportDialog` method on `BrowserClient` (#4973)
- Removed deprecated `startSpan` and `child` methods (#4849)
- Removed deprecated `frameContextLines` options (#4884)
- Removed `Sentry` from window in the Gatsby SDK (#4857)

#### Internal

- Removed support for the store endpoint (#4969)
- Made hint callback argument non-optional (#5141)
- Switched to using new transports internally (#4943)
- [Removed `API` class from `@sentry/core`.](./MIGRATION.md#removing-the-api-class-from-sentrycore). (#4848)
- [Refactored `Session` class to use a more functional approach.](./MIGRATION.md#session-changes). (#5054)
- Removed `Backend` class in favour of moving functionality into the `Client` class (for more details, see
  [#4911](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/4911) and
  [#4919](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/4919)).
- Removed forget async utility function (#4941)
- Removed tslint from `@sentry-internal/typescript` (#4940)
- Removed `_invokeClient` function from `@sentry/hub` (#4972)
- Removed top level eventbuilder exports (#4887)

change in your context data. If this is a problem, you can increase the limit with the new `maxNormalizationBreadth`
setting. See [#4689](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/4689) for details.

## 6.18.2

If you are using `@sentry-internal/eslint-config-sdk`, please note that this release turns on the
[quotes rule](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/quotes) to enforce usage of single quotes.

This release also removes `@sentry/tracing` as a dependency of `@sentry/node`. Please explicitly install and import
`@sentry/tracing` if you want to use performance monitoring capabilities. For more details,
[see our docs on setting up Node Performance Monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/node/performance/).

We also now produce an ES6 version of our
[CDN tracing bundle](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/install/cdn/#performance-bundle), which can be accessed
with `bundle.tracing.es6.min.js`.

- chore(eslint): Turn on quotes rules (#4671)

## 6.17.5

This release deprecates the `Severity` enum, the `SeverityLevel` type, and the internal `SeverityLevels` array, all from
`@sentry/types`. In v7, `Severity` will disappear (in favor of `SeverityLevel`) and `SeverityLevel` and `SeverityLevels`
will live in `@sentry/utils`. If you are using any of the three, we encourage you to migrate your usage now, using our
[migration guide](./MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6.x-to-6.17.x).

- ref: Export Session class from core/browser/node (#4508)
- chore(nextjs): Bump`@sentry/webpack-plugin` to 1.18.5 (#4501)
- ref(types): Move SeverityLevel and SeverityLevels to `@sentry/utils` (#4492)
- fix(vue): Cast name parameter to string (#4483)

Work in this release contributed by @Bobakanoosh and @ssnielsen. Thank you for your contributions!

## 6.17.4

- chore(deps): Bump `@sentry/webpack-plugin` from 1.18.3 to 1.18.4 (#4464)
- fix(browser): Set severity level for events captured by the global error handler (#4460)
- fix(integrations): Add default for `ExtraErrorData`'s `depth` option (#4487)
- fix(nextjs): Export `BrowserTracing` integration directly (#4480)
- fix(tracing): Export `SpanStatus` enum (#4478)
- fix(vue): Property `_isVue` not defined in Vue3 (#4461)

Work in this release contributed by @7inspire, @jaeseokk, and @rchl. Thank you for your contributions!

## 6.17.3

- fix(nextjs): Unwrap `req` and `res` if necessary when instrumenting server (#4467)

## 6.17.2

This patch contains a breaking change for anyone setting the undocumented `rethrowAfterCapture` option for
`@sentry/serverless`'s AWS wrapper to `false`, as its functionality has been removed. For backwards compatibility with
anyone setting it to `true` (which is also the default), the option remains in the `WrapperOptions` type for now. It
will be removed in the next major release, though, so we recommend removing it from your code.

- ref(serverless): Remove `rethrowAfterCapture` use in AWS lambda wrapper (#4448)
- fix(utils): Remove dom `is` casting (#4451)

## 6.17.1

## 6.17.0

This release contains several internal refactors that help reduce the bundle size of the SDK and help prep for our
[upcoming major release](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/4240). There are no breaking changes in
this patch unless you are using our internal `Dsn` class, which has been removed. We also deprecated a few of our
typescript enums and our internal `API` class. We've detailed in our
[migration documentation](./MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6.x-to-6.17.x) how to update your sdk usage if you are using any
of these in your code.

## 6.0.0

_This major version release doesn't contain any breaking API/code changes._ Starting from the version `6.0.0`, all SDKs
that support sending sessions data will do so by default. See our
[Release Health](https://docs.sentry.io/product/releases/health/) docs to learn more. As of this version, it applies to
all Browser SDKs (Browser, React, Angular, Vue, Gatsby etc.). Node.js and other related Server SDKs will follow soon
after, in the minor `6.x` release. You can opt-out of this behavior by setting `autoSessionTracking: false` option
during SDK initialization.

_If you are a `@sentry/apm` and did manual instrumentation using `hub.startSpan` please be aware of the changes we did
to the API. The recommended entry point for manual instrumentation now is `Sentry.startTransaction` and creating child
Span by calling `startChild` on it. We have internal workarounds in place so the old code should still work but will be
removed in the future. If you are only using the `Tracing` integration there is no need for action._

in their own package called `@sentry/integrations`. For a detailed guide how to upgrade from `4.x` to `5.x` refer to our
[migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/MIGRATION.md).

## 4.0.0

This is the release of our new SDKs, `@sentry/browser`, `@sentry/node`. While there are too many changes to list for
this release, we will keep a consistent changelog for upcoming new releases. `raven-js` (our legacy JavaScript/Browser
SDK) and `raven` (our legacy Node.js SDK) will still reside in this repo, but they will receive their own changelog.

We generally guide people to use our new SDKs from this point onward. The migration should be straightforward if you
were only using the basic features of our previous SDKs.

`raven-js` and `raven` will both still receive bugfixes but all the new features implemented will only work in the new
SDKs. The new SDKs are completely written in TypeScript, which means all functions, classes and properties are typed.

### Migration

Here are some examples of how the new SDKs work. Please note that the API for all JavaScript SDKs is the same.

#### Installation

_Old_:

```js
Raven.config('___PUBLIC_DSN___', {
  release: '1.3.0',
}).install();
```

_New_:

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  release: '1.3.0',
});
```

#### Set a global tag

_Old_:

```js
Raven.setTagsContext({ key: 'value' });
```

_New_:

```js
Sentry.configureScope(scope => {
  scope.setTag('key', 'value');
});
```

#### Capture custom exception

_Old_:

```js
try {
  throwingFunction();
} catch (e) {
  Raven.captureException(e, { extra: { debug: false } });
}
```

_New_:

```js
try {
  throwingFunction();
} catch (e) {
  Sentry.withScope(scope => {
    scope.setExtra('debug', false);
    Sentry.captureException(e);
  });
}
```

#### Capture a message

_Old_:

```js
Raven.captureMessage('test', 'info', { extra: { debug: false } });
```

_New_:

```js
Sentry.withScope(scope => {
  scope.setExtra('debug', false);
  Sentry.captureMessage('test', 'info');
});
```

#### Breadcrumbs

_Old_:

```js
Raven.captureBreadcrumb({
  message: 'Item added to shopping cart',
  category: 'action',
  data: {
    isbn: '978-1617290541',
    cartSize: '3',
  },
});
```

_New_:

```js
Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
  message: 'Item added to shopping cart',
  category: 'action',
  data: {
    isbn: '978-1617290541',
    cartSize: '3',
  },
});
```
