## 10.17.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(nuxt): Implement server middleware instrumentation ([#17796](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17796))**

  This release introduces instrumentation for Nuxt middleware, ensuring that all middleware handlers are automatically wrapped with tracing and error reporting functionality.

## 10.15.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(cloudflare): Add honoIntegration with error-filtering function ([#17743](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17743))**

  This release adds a `honoIntegration` to `@sentry/cloudflare`, which exposes a `shouldHandleError` function that lets you define which errors in `onError` should be captured.
  By default, Sentry captures exceptions with `error.status >= 500 || error.status <= 299`.

  The integration is added by default, and it's possible to modify this behavior like this:

  ```js
   integrations: [
     honoIntegration({
      shouldHandleError: (err) => true; // always capture exceptions in onError
     })
   ]
  ```

- **feat(node): Add instrumentation for hono handler ([#17428](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17428))**

This PR enhances the Hono integration by adding comprehensive handler instrumentation, error handling capabilities.

- **feat(aws): Enable Lambda extension by default when using the Lamba layer ([#17684](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17684))**

- **feat(browser): Add `setActiveSpanInBrowser` to set an active span in the browser ([#17714](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17714))**

This PR adds a feature to the browser SDKs only: Making an inactive span active. We do this to enable use cases where having a span only being active in the callback is not practical.

### Other Changes

- fix(browser): Improve handling of `0` and `undefined` resource timing values ([#17751](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17751))
- ref(nextjs): Display build compatibility warning for webpack ([#17746](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17746))

## 10.14.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(cloudflare,vercel-edge): Add support for Google Gen AI instrumentation ([#17723](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17723))**

  The SDK now supports manually instrumenting Google's Gen AI operations in Cloudflare Workers and Vercel Edge Runtime environments, providing insights into your AI operations. You can use `const wrappedClient = Sentry.instrumentGoogleGenAIClient(genAiClient)` to get an instrumented client.

### Other Changes

- fix(nextjs): Display updated turbopack warnings ([#17737](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17737))

</details>

## 10.13.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(browser): Add option to explicitly end pageload span via `reportPageLoaded()` ([#17697](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17697))**

  With this release you can take manual control of ending the pageload span. Usually this span is ended automatically by the SDK, based on a period of inactivity after the initial page was loaded in the browser. If you want full control over the pageload duration, you can tell Sentry, when your page was fully loaded:

  ```js
  Sentry.init({
    //...
    integrations: [
      // 1. Enable manual pageload reporting
      Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({ enableReportPageLoaded: true }),
    ],
  });

  // 2. Whenever you decide the page is loaded, call:
  Sentry.reportPageLoaded();
  ```

  Note that if `Sentry.reportPageLoaded()` is not called within 30 seconds of the initial pageload (or whatever value the `finalTimeout` option is set to), the pageload span will be ended automatically.

- **feat(core,node): Add instrumentation for `GoogleGenAI` ([#17625](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17625))**

  The SDK now automatically instruments the `@google/genai` package to provide insights into your AI operations.

- **feat(nextjs): Promote `useRunAfterProductionCompileHook` to non-experimental build option ([#17721](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17721))**

  The `useRunAfterProductionCompileHook` option is no longer experimental and is now a stable build option for Next.js projects.

- **feat(nextjs): Use `afterProductionCompile` hook for webpack builds ([#17655](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17655))**

  Next.js projects using webpack can opt-in to use the `useRunAfterProductionCompileHook` hook for source map uploads.

- **feat(nextjs): Flip default value for `useRunAfterProductionCompileHook` for Turbopack builds ([#17722](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17722))**

  The `useRunAfterProductionCompileHook` option is now enabled by default for Turbopack builds, enabling automated source map uploads.

- **feat(node): Do not drop 300 and 304 status codes by default ([#17686](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17686))**

  HTTP transactions with 300 and 304 status codes are now captured by default, providing better visibility into redirect and caching behavior.

### Important Changes

- **ref: Add and Adjust error event `mechanism` values**

  This release includes a variety of changes aimed at setting the `mechanism` field on errors captured automatically by the Sentry SDKs. [The intention](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/17212) is to clearly mark which instrumentation captured an error. In addition, some instrumentations previously did not yet annotate the error as handled or unhandled which this series of PRs corrects as well.

- **feat(node) Ensure `prismaIntegration` works with Prisma 5 ([#17595](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17595))**

We used to require to pass in the v5 version of `@prisma/instrumentation` into `prismaIntegration({ prismaInstrumentation: new PrismaInstrumentation() })`, if you wanted to get full instrumentation for Prisma v5. However, it turns out this does not work on v10 of the SDK anymore, because `@prisma/instrumentation@5` requires OTEL v1.

With this release, we dropped the requirement to configure anything to get v5 support of Prisma. You do not need to configure anything in the integration anymore, and can remove the dependency on `@prisma/instrumentation@5` if you had it in your application. You only need to configure the `tracing` preview feature [according to our docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/node/configuration/integrations/prisma/).

## 10.11.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(aws): Add experimental AWS Lambda extension for tunnelling events ([#17525](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17525))**

  This release adds an experimental Sentry Lambda extension to the existing Sentry Lambda layer. Sentry events are now tunneled through the extension and then forwarded to Sentry. This has the benefit of reducing the request processing time.

  To enable it, set `_experiments.enableLambdaExtension` in your Sentry config like this:

  ```javascript
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: '<YOUR_DSN>',
    _experiments: {
      enableLambdaExtension: true,
    },
  });
  ```

## 10.10.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(browser): Add support for `propagateTraceparent` SDK option ([#17509](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17509))**

Adds support for a new browser SDK init option, `propagateTraceparent` for attaching a W3C compliant traceparent header to outgoing fetch and XHR requests, in addition to sentry-trace and baggage headers. More details can be found [here](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/telemetry/traces/#propagatetraceparent).

- **feat(core): Add tool calls attributes for Anthropic AI ([#17478](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17478))**

Adds missing tool call attributes, we add gen_ai.response.tool_calls attribute for Anthropic AI, supporting both streaming and non-streaming requests.

- **feat(nextjs): Use compiler hook for uploading turbopack sourcemaps ([#17352](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17352))**

Adds a new _experimental_ flag `_experimental.useRunAfterProductionCompileHook` to `withSentryConfig` for automatic source maps uploads when building a Next.js app with `next build --turbopack`.
When set we:

- Automatically enable source map generation for turbopack client files (if not explicitly disabled)
- Upload generated source maps to Sentry at the end of the build by leveraging [a Next.js compiler hook](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler#runafterproductioncompile).

### Other Changes

- feat(feedback): Add more labels so people can configure Highlight and Hide labels ([#17513](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17513))
- fix(node): Add `origin` for OpenAI spans & test auto instrumentation ([#17519](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17519))

## 10.9.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(node): Update `httpIntegration` handling of incoming requests ([#17371](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17371))**

This version updates the handling of the Node SDK of incoming requests. Instead of relying on @opentelemetry/instrumentation-http, we now handle incoming request instrumentation internally, ensuring that we can optimize performance as much as possible and avoid interop problems.

This change should not affect you, unless you're relying on very in-depth implementation details. Importantly, this also drops the `_experimentalConfig` option of the integration - this will no longer do anything.
Finally, you can still pass `instrumentation.{requestHook,responseHook,applyCustomAttributesOnSpan}` options, but they are deprecated and will be removed in v11. Instead, you can use the new `incomingRequestSpanHook` configuration option if you want to adjust the incoming request span.

### Other Changes

## 10.8.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(sveltekit): Add Compatibility for builtin SvelteKit Tracing ([#17423](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17423))**

  This release makes the `@sentry/sveltekit` SDK compatible with SvelteKit's native [observability support](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/observability) introduced in SvelteKit version `2.31.0`.
  If you enable both, instrumentation and tracing, the SDK will now initialize early enough to set up additional instrumentation like database queries and it will pick up spans emitted from SvelteKit.

  We will follow up with docs how to set up the SDK soon.
  For now, If you're on SvelteKit version `2.31.0` or newer, you can easily opt into the new feature:
  1. Enable [experimental tracing and instrumentation support](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/observability) in `svelte.config.js`:
  2. Move your `Sentry.init()` call from `src/hooks.server.(js|ts)` to the new `instrumentation.server.(js|ts)` file:

     ```ts
     // instrumentation.server.ts
     import * as Sentry from '@sentry/sveltekit';

     Sentry.init({
       dsn: '...',
       // rest of your config
     });
     ```

     The rest of your Sentry config in `hooks.server.ts` (`sentryHandle` and `handleErrorWithSentry`) should stay the same.

  If you prefer to stay on the hooks-file based config for now, the SDK will continue to work as previously.

  Thanks to the Svelte team and @elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github for implementing observability support and for reviewing our PR!

## 10.7.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(cloudflare): Add `instrumentPrototypeMethods` option to instrument RPC methods for DurableObjects ([#17424](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17424))**

By default, `Sentry.instrumentDurableObjectWithSentry` will not wrap any RPC methods on the prototype. To enable wrapping for RPC methods, set `instrumentPrototypeMethods` to `true` or, if performance is a concern, a list of only the methods you want to instrument:

```js
class MyDurableObjectBase extends DurableObject<Env> {
  method1() {
    // ...
  }

  method2() {
    // ...
  }

  method3() {
    // ...
  }
}
// Export your named class as defined in your wrangler config
export const MyDurableObject = Sentry.instrumentDurableObjectWithSentry(
  (env: Env) => ({
    dsn: "https://ac49b7af3017c458bd12dab9b3328bfc@o4508482761982032.ingest.de.sentry.io/4508482780987481",
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
    instrumentPrototypeMethods: ['method1', 'method3'],
  }),
  MyDurableObjectBase,
);
```

## 10.4.0

### Important Changes

- **fix(browser): Ensure IP address is only inferred by Relay if `sendDefaultPii` is `true`**

This release includes a fix for a [behaviour change](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/migration/v8-to-v9/#behavior-changes)
that was originally introduced with v9 of the SDK: User IP Addresses should only be added to Sentry events automatically,
if `sendDefaultPii` was set to `true`.

However, the change in v9 required further internal adjustment, which should have been included in v10 of the SDK.
Unfortunately, the change did not make it into the initial v10 version but is now applied with `10.4.0`.
There is _no API_ breakage involved and hence it is safe to update.
However, after updating the SDK, events (errors, traces, replays, etc.) sent from the browser, will only include
user IP addresses, if you set `sendDefaultPii: true` in your `Sentry.init` options.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused!

- **feat(node): Add `ignoreStaticAssets` ([#17370](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17370))**

This release adds a new option to `httpIntegration` to ignore requests for static assets (e.g. `favicon.xml` or `robots.txt`). The option defaults to `true`, meaning that going forward, such requests will not be traced by default. You can still enable tracing for these requests by setting the option to `false`:

```js
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    Sentry.httpIntegration({
      // defaults to true, set to false to enable traces for static assets
      ignoreStaticAssets: false,
    }),
  ],
});
```

## 10.2.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(core): Add `ignoreSpans` option ([#17078](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17078))**

This release adds a new top-level `Sentry.init` option, `ignoreSpans`, that can be used as follows:

```js
Sentry.init({
  ignoreSpans: [
    'partial match', // string matching on the span name
    /regex/, // regex matching on the span name
    {
      name: 'span name',
      op: /http.client/,
    },
  ],
});
```

Spans matching the filter criteria will not be recorded. Potential child spans of filtered spans will be re-parented, if possible.

- **feat(cloudflare,vercel-edge): Add support for OpenAI instrumentation ([#17338](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17338))**

Adds support for OpenAI manual instrumentation in `@sentry/cloudflare` and `@sentry/vercel-edge`.

To instrument the OpenAI client, wrap it with `Sentry.instrumentOpenAiClient` and set recording settings.

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/cloudflare';
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI();
const client = Sentry.instrumentOpenAiClient(openai, { recordInputs: true, recordOutputs: true });

// use the wrapped client
```

- **ref(aws): Remove manual span creation ([#17310](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17310))**

The `startTrace` option is deprecated and will be removed in a future major version. If you want to disable tracing, set `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` to `0.0`. instead. As of today, the flag does not affect traces anymore.

### Important Changes

- **feat(v9/core): Deprecate experimental `enableLogs` and `beforeSendLog` option ([#17092](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17092))**

Sentry now has support for [structured logging](https://docs.sentry.io/product/explore/logs/getting-started/). Previously to enable structured logging, you had to use the `_experiments.enableLogs` and `_experiments.beforeSendLog` options. These options have been deprecated in favor of the top-level `enableLogs` and `beforeSendLog` options.

```js
// before
Sentry.init({
  _experiments: {
    enableLogs: true,
    beforeSendLog: log => {
      return log;
    },
  },
});

// after
Sentry.init({
  enableLogs: true,
  beforeSendLog: log => {
    return log;
  },
});
```

- **feat(astro): Implement parameterized routes**
  - feat(v9/astro): Parametrize dynamic server routes ([#17141](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17141))
  - feat(v9/astro): Parametrize routes on client-side ([#17143](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17143))

Server-side and client-side parameterized routes are now supported in the Astro SDK. No configuration changes are required.

## 9.40.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(browser): Add debugId sync APIs between web worker and main thread ([#16981](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16981))**

This release adds two Browser SDK APIs to let the main thread know about debugIds of worker files:

- `webWorkerIntegration({worker})` to be used in the main thread
- `registerWebWorker({self})` to be used in the web worker

```js
// main.js
Sentry.init({...})

const worker = new MyWorker(...);

Sentry.addIntegration(Sentry.webWorkerIntegration({ worker }));

worker.addEventListener('message', e => {...});
```

```js
// worker.js
Sentry.registerWebWorker({ self });

self.postMessage(...);
```

- **feat(core): Deprecate logger in favor of debug ([#17040](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17040))**

The internal SDK `logger` export from `@sentry/core` has been deprecated in favor of the `debug` export. `debug` only exposes `log`, `warn`, and `error` methods but is otherwise identical to `logger`. Note that this deprecation does not affect the `logger` export from other packages (like `@sentry/browser` or `@sentry/node`) which is used for Sentry Logging.

```js
import { logger, debug } from '@sentry/core';

// before
logger.info('This is an info message');

// after
debug.log('This is an info message');
```

- **feat(node): Add OpenAI integration ([#17022](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17022))**

This release adds official support for instrumenting OpenAI SDK calls in with Sentry tracing, following OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for Generative AI. It instruments:

- `client.chat.completions.create()` - For chat-based completions
- `client.responses.create()` - For the responses API

```js
// The integration respects your `sendDefaultPii` option, but you can override the behavior in the integration options

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '__DSN__',
  integrations: [
    Sentry.openAIIntegration({
      recordInputs: true, // Force recording prompts
      recordOutputs: true, // Force recording responses
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Other Changes

- feat(node-core): Expand `@opentelemetry/instrumentation` range to cover `0.203.0` ([#17043](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17043))

- fix(sveltekit): Ensure server errors from streamed responses are sent ([#17044](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/17044))

Work in this release was contributed by @0xbad0c0d3 and @tommy-gilligan. Thank you for your contributions!

## 9.39.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(browser): Add `afterStartPageloadSpan` hook to improve spanId assignment on web vital spans ([#16893](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16893))**

This PR adds a new afterStartPageloadSpan lifecycle hook to more robustly assign the correct pageload span ID to web vital spans, replacing the previous unreliable "wait for a tick" approach with a direct callback that fires when the pageload span becomes available.

- **feat(nextjs): Client-side parameterized routes ([#16934](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16934))**

This PR implements client-side parameterized routes for Next.js by leveraging an injected manifest within the existing app-router instrumentation to automatically parameterize all client-side transactions (e.g. `users/123` and `users/456` now become become `users/:id`).

- **feat(node): Drop 401-404 and 3xx status code spans by default ([#16972](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16972))**

This PR changes the default behavior in the Node SDK to drop HTTP spans with 401-404 and 3xx status codes by default to reduce noise in tracing data.

## 9.37.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(nuxt): Parametrize SSR routes ([#16843](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16843))**

  When requesting dynamic or catch-all routes in Nuxt, those will now be shown as parameterized routes in Sentry.
  For example, `/users/123` will be shown as `/users/:userId()` in Sentry. This will make it easier to identify patterns and make grouping easier.

## 9.36.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(node-core): Add node-core SDK ([#16745](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16745))**

This release adds a new SDK `@sentry/node-core` which ships without any OpenTelemetry instrumententation out of the box. All OpenTelemetry dependencies are peer dependencies and OpenTelemetry has to be set up manually.

Use `@sentry/node-core` when:

- You already have OpenTelemetry set up
- You need custom OpenTelemetry configuration
- You want minimal dependencies
- You need fine-grained control over instrumentation

Use `@sentry/node` when:

- You want an automatic setup
- You're new to OpenTelemetry
- You want sensible defaults
- You prefer convenience over control

* **feat(node): Deprecate ANR integration ([#16832](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16832))**

The ANR integration has been deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Use `eventLoopBlockIntegration` from `@sentry/node-native` instead.

- **feat(replay): Add `_experiments.ignoreMutations` option ([#16816](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16816))**

This replay option allows to configure a selector list of elements to not capture mutations for.

```js
Sentry.replayIntegration({
  _experiments: {
    ignoreMutations: ['.dragging'],
  },
});
```

## 9.34.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(nuxt): Add Cloudflare Nitro plugin ([#15597](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15597))**

  A Nitro plugin for `@sentry/nuxt` which initializes Sentry when deployed to Cloudflare (`cloudflare-pages` preset).
  1. Remove the previous server config file: `sentry.server.config.ts`
  2. Add a plugin in `server/plugins` (e.g. `server/plugins/sentry-cloudflare-setup.ts`)
  3. Add this code in your plugin file

     ```javascript
     // server/plugins/sentry-cloudflare-setup.ts (filename does not matter)
     import { sentryCloudflareNitroPlugin } from '@sentry/nuxt/module/plugins';

     export default defineNitroPlugin(
       sentryCloudflareNitroPlugin({
         dsn: 'https://dsn',
         tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
       }),
     );
     ```

     or with access to `nitroApp`:

     ```javascript
     // server/plugins/sentry-cloudflare-setup.ts (filename does not matter)
     import { sentryCloudflareNitroPlugin } from '@sentry/nuxt/module/plugins';

     export default defineNitroPlugin(sentryCloudflareNitroPlugin((nitroApp: NitroApp) => {
       // You can access nitroApp here if needed
       return  ({
         dsn: 'https://dsn',
         tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
       })

### Important Changes

- **feat: Add opt-in `vercelAiIntegration` to cloudflare & vercel-edge ([#16732](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16732))**

The `vercelAiIntegration` is now available as opt-in for the Cloudflare and the Next.js SDK for Vercel Edge.
To use it, add the integration in `Sentry.init`

```js
Sentry.init({
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  integrations: [Sentry.vercelAIIntegration()],
});
```

And enable telemetry for Vercel AI calls

```js
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
  },
});
```

- **feat(node): Add postgresjs instrumentation ([#16665](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16665))**

- feat(cloudflare): Add `instrumentWorkflowWithSentry` to instrument workflows ([#16672](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16672))

We've added support for Cloudflare Workflows, enabling comprehensive tracing for your workflow runs. This integration uses the workflow's instanceId as the Sentry trace_id and for sampling, linking all steps together. You'll now be able to see full traces, including retries with exponential backoff.

## 9.28.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(nestjs): Stop creating spans for `TracingInterceptor` ([#16501](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16501))**

With this change we stop creating spans for `TracingInterceptor` as this interceptor only serves as an internal helper and adds noise for the user.

- **feat(node): Update vercel ai spans as per new conventions ([#16497](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16497))**

This feature ships updates to the span names and ops to better match OpenTelemetry. This should make them more easily accessible to the new agents module view we are building.

- **feat(cloudflare): Add support for durable objects ([#16180](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16180))**

This PR introduces a new `instrumentDurableObjectWithSentry` method to the SDK, which instruments durable objects. We capture both traces and errors automatically.

- **feat(node): Add Prisma integration by default ([#16073](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16073))**

[Prisma integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/integrations/prisma/) is enabled by default, it should work for both ESM and CJS.

- **feat(react-router): Add client-side router instrumentation ([#16185](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16185))**

Adds client-side instrumentation for react router's `HydratedRouter`. To enable it, simply replace `browserTracingIntegration()` with `reactRouterTracingIntegration()` in your client-side init call.

- **fix(node): Avoid double-wrapping http module ([#16177](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16177))**

When running your application in ESM mode, there have been scenarios that resulted in the `http`/`https` emitting duplicate spans for incoming requests. This was apparently caused by us double-wrapping the modules for incoming request isolation.

In order to solve this problem, the modules are no longer monkey patched by us for request isolation. Instead, we register diagnostics*channel hooks to handle request isolation now.
While this is generally not expected to break anything, there is one tiny change that \_may* affect you if you have been relying on very specific functionality:

The `ignoreOutgoingRequests` option of `httpIntegration` receives the `RequestOptions` as second argument. This type is not changed, however due to how the wrapping now works, we no longer pass through the full RequestOptions, but re-construct this partially based on the generated request. For the vast majority of cases, this should be fine, but for the sake of completeness, these are the only fields that may be available there going forward - other fields that _may_ have existed before may no longer be set:

```ts
ignoreOutgoingRequests(url: string, {
  method: string;
  protocol: string;
  host: string;
  hostname: string; // same as host
  path: string;
  headers: OutgoingHttpHeaders;
})
```

## 9.13.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(node): Add support for winston logger ([#15983](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15983))**

  Sentry is adding support for [structured logging](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/discussions/15916). In this release we've added support for sending logs to Sentry via the [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logger to the Sentry Node SDK (and SDKs that use the Node SDK under the hood like `@sentry/nestjs`). The Logging APIs in the Sentry SDK are still experimental and subject to change.

  ```js
  const winston = require('winston');
  const Transport = require('winston-transport');

  const transport = Sentry.createSentryWinstonTransport(Transport);

  const logger = winston.createLogger({
    transports: [transport],
  });
  ```

- **feat(core): Add `wrapMcpServerWithSentry` to instrument MCP servers from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ([#16032](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16032))**

  The Sentry SDK now supports instrumenting MCP servers from the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` package. Compatible with versions `^1.9.0` of the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` package.

  ```js
  import { McpServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js';

  // Create an MCP server
  const server = new McpServer({
    name: 'Demo',
    version: '1.0.0',
  });

  // Use the instrumented server in your application
  const instrumentedServer = Sentry.wrapMcpServerWithSentry(server);
  ```

- **feat(core): Move console integration into core and add to cloudflare/vercel-edge ([#16024](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16024))**

  Console instrumentation has been added to `@sentry/cloudflare` and `@sentry/nextjs` Edge Runtime and is enabled by default. Now calls to the console object will be captured as breadcrumbs for those SDKs.

- **feat(bun): Support new `Bun.serve` APIs ([#16035](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/16035))**

  Bun `1.2.6` and above have a new `Bun.serve` API, which the Bun SDK now supports. The SDK instruments the new routes object that can be used to define routes for the server.

  Thanks to @Jarred-Sumner for helping us get this supported!

## 9.12.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(feedback): Implement highlighting and hiding controls for screenshots ([#15951](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15951))**

  The Sentry SDK now supports highlighting and hiding controls for screenshots in [user feedback reports](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/user-feedback/). This functionality is enabled by default.

- **feat(node): Add `ignoreIncomingRequestBody` callback to `httpIntegration` ([#15959](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15959))**

  The `httpIntegration` now supports an optional `ignoreIncomingRequestBody` callback that can be used to skip capturing the body of incoming requests.

  ```ts
  Sentry.init({
    integrations: [
      Sentry.httpIntegration({
        ignoreIncomingRequestBody: (url, request) => {
          return request.method === 'GET' && url.includes('/api/large-payload');
        },
      }),
    ],
  });
  ```

  The `ignoreIncomingRequestBody` callback receives the URL of the request and should return `true` if the body should be ignored.

## 9.10.0

### Important Changes

- **feat: Add support for logs**
  - feat(node): Add logging public APIs to Node SDKs ([#15764](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15764))
  - feat(core): Add support for `beforeSendLog` ([#15814](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15814))
  - feat(core): Add support for parameterizing logs ([#15812](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15812))
  - fix: Remove critical log severity level ([#15824](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15824))

  All JavaScript SDKs other than `@sentry/cloudflare` and `@sentry/deno` now support sending logs via dedicated methods as part of Sentry's [upcoming logging product](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/86804).

  Logging is gated by an experimental option, `_experiments.enableLogs`.

  ```js
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: 'PUBLIC_DSN',
    // `enableLogs` must be set to true to use the logging features
    _experiments: { enableLogs: true },
  });

  const { trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, fmt } = Sentry.logger;

  trace('Starting database connection', { database: 'users' });
  debug('Cache miss for user', { userId: 123 });
  error('Failed to process payment', { orderId: 'order_123', amount: 99.99 });
  fatal('Database connection pool exhausted', { database: 'users', activeConnections: 100 });

  // Structured logging via the `fmt` helper function. When you use `fmt`, the string template and parameters are sent separately so they can be queried independently in Sentry.

  info(fmt(`Updated profile for user ${userId}`));
  warn(fmt(`Rate limit approaching for endpoint ${endpoint}. Requests: ${requests}, Limit: ${limit}`));
  ```

  With server-side SDKs like `@sentry/node`, `@sentry/bun` or server-side of `@sentry/nextjs` or `@sentry/sveltekit`, you can do structured logging without needing the `fmt` helper function.

  ```js
  const { info, warn } = Sentry.logger;

  info('User %s logged in successfully', [123]);
  warn('Failed to load user %s data', [123], { errorCode: 404 });
  ```

  To filter logs, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the `_experiments.beforeSendLog` option.

- **feat(browser): Add `diagnoseSdkConnectivity()` function to programmatically detect possible connectivity issues ([#15821](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15821))**

  The `diagnoseSdkConnectivity()` function can be used to programmatically detect possible connectivity issues with the Sentry SDK.

  ```js
  const result = await Sentry.diagnoseSdkConnectivity();
  ```

  The result will be an object with the following properties:
  - `"no-client-active"`: There was no active client when the function was called. This possibly means that the SDK was not initialized yet.
  - `"sentry-unreachable"`: The Sentry SaaS servers were not reachable. This likely means that there is an ad blocker active on the page or that there are other connection issues.
  - `undefined`: The SDK is working as expected.

- **SDK Tracing Performance Improvements for Node SDKs**
  - feat: Stop using `dropUndefinedKeys` ([#15796](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15796))
  - feat(node): Only add span listeners for instrumentation when used ([#15802](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15802))
  - ref: Avoid `dropUndefinedKeys` for `spanToJSON` calls ([#15792](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15792))
  - ref: Avoid using `SentryError` for PromiseBuffer control flow ([#15822](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15822))
  - ref: Stop using `dropUndefinedKeys` in SpanExporter ([#15794](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15794))
  - ref(core): Avoid using `SentryError` for event processing control flow ([#15823](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15823))
  - ref(node): Avoid `dropUndefinedKeys` in Node SDK init ([#15797](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15797))
  - ref(opentelemetry): Avoid sampling work for non-root spans ([#15820](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15820))

  We've been hard at work making performance improvements to the Sentry Node SDKs (`@sentry/node`, `@sentry/aws-serverless`, `@sentry/nestjs`, etc.). We've seen that upgrading from `9.7.0` to `9.10.0` leads to 30-40% improvement in request latency for HTTP web-server applications that use tracing with high sample rates. Non web-server applications and non-tracing applications will see smaller improvements.

### Other Changes

- chore(deps): Bump `rrweb` to `2.35.0` ([#15825](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15825))
- deps: Bump bundler plugins to `3.2.3` ([#15829](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15829))

- feat(nextjs): Disable server webpack-handling for static builds ([#15751](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15751))
- fix(nuxt): Don't override Nuxt options if undefined ([#15795](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15795))

## 9.9.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(nextjs): Support `instrumentation-client.ts` ([#15705](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15705))**

  Next.js recently added a feature to support [client-side (browser) instrumentation via a `instrumentation-client.ts` file](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/instrumentation-client).

  To be forwards compatible, the Sentry Next.js SDK will now pick up `instrumentation-client.ts` files even on older Next.js versions and add them to your client bundles.
  It is suggested that you either rename your `sentry.client.config.ts` file to `instrumentation-client.ts`, or if you already happen to have a `instrumentation-client.ts` file move the contents of `sentry.client.config.ts` to `instrumentation-client.ts`.

- **feat(browser): Add `previous_trace` span links ([#15569](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15569))**

  The `@sentry/browser` SDK and SDKs based on `@sentry/browser` now emits a link from the first root span of a newly started trace to the root span of a previously started trace. You can control this feature via an option in `browserTracingIntegration()`:

  ```js
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: 'your-dsn-here'
    integrations: [
      Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({
        // Available settings:
        // - 'in-memory' (default): Stores previous trace information in memory
        // - 'session-storage': Stores previous trace information in the browser's `sessionStorage`
        // - 'off': Disable storing and sending previous trace information
        linkPreviousTrace: 'in-memory',
      }),
    ],
  });
  ```

- **feat(browser): Add `logger.X` methods to browser SDK ([#15763](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/15763))**

  For Sentry's [upcoming logging product](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/86804), the SDK now supports sending logs via dedicated methods.

  ```js
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: 'your-dsn-here',
    _experiments: {
      enableLogs: true, // This is required to use the logging features
    },
  });

  Sentry.logger.info('This is a trace message', { userId: 123 });
  // See PR for better documentation
  ```

  Please note that the logs product is still in early access. See the link above for more information.

  Since TanStack Start is supposed to be a generic framework that supports libraries like React and Solid, the `@sentry/tanstackstart` SDK package was renamed to `@sentry/tanstackstart-react` to reflect that the SDK is specifically intended to be used for React TanStack Start applications.
  Note that the TanStack Start SDK is still in alpha status and may be subject to breaking changes in non-major package updates.

## 9.0.0

Version `9.0.0` marks a release of the Sentry JavaScript SDKs that contains breaking changes.
The goal of this release is to trim down on unused and potentially confusing APIs, prepare the SDKs for future framework versions to build deeper instrumentation, and remove old polyfills to reduce the packages' size.

### How To Upgrade

Please carefully read through the migration guide in the Sentry docs on how to upgrade from version 8 to version 9.
Make sure to select your specific platform/framework in the top left corner: https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/migration/v8-to-v9/

A comprehensive migration guide outlining all changes for all the frameworks can be found within the Sentry JavaScript SDK Repository: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md
