  # To not use a proxy (e.g. npm) but instead use verdaccio for package hosting we need to define rules here without the
  # `proxy` field. Sadly we can't use a wildcard like "@sentry/*" because we have some dependencies (@sentry/cli,
  # @sentry/webpack-plugin) that fall under that wildcard but don't live in this repository. If we were to use that
  # wildcard, we would get a 404 when attempting to install them, since they weren't uploaded to verdaccio, and also
  # don't have a proxy configuration.

# A value of 0 makes the http server behave similarly to Node.js versions prior to 8.0.0, which did not have a keep-alive timeout.
# WORKAROUND: Through given configuration you can workaround following issue https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/301. Set to 0 in case 60 is not enough.
