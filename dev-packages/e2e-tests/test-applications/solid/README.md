## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely
be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Exploring the template

This template's goal is to showcase the routing features of Solid. It also showcase how the router and Suspense work
together to parallelize data fetching tied to a route via the `.data.ts` pattern.

You can learn more about it on the [`@solidjs/router` repository](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-router)
