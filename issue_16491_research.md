## TODO and FIXME Analysis

### High-Priority TODOs Found:
- `packages/replay-internal/src/replay.ts`: File splitting needed (max-lines exceeded)
- `packages/nestjs/src/integrations/sentry-nest-core-instrumentation.ts`: Multiple incomplete implementations
- `packages/nextjs/src/common/devErrorSymbolicationEventProcessor.ts`: Port handling needs improvement
- `packages/node/src/transports/http.ts`: keepAlive evaluation needed

### Critical FIXMEs:
- `packages/core/src/carrier.ts`: Problematic carrier function
- `packages/core/src/utils/syncpromise.ts`: Unspecified issue
- `dev-packages/node-integration-tests/suites/express/tracing/test.ts`: Incorrect test behavior

## Repository Structure Analysis

### Core Packages:
- `packages/core/` - Base SDK functionality
- `packages/types/` - TypeScript definitions
- `packages/browser-utils/` - Browser utilities

### Platform SDKs:
- `packages/browser/`, `packages/node/` - Core platform SDKs
- Framework packages: `vue/`, `react/`, `nextjs/`, `angular/`, etc.
- Runtime packages: `bun/`, `deno/`, `cloudflare/`

### Development Guidelines:
- Uses Gitflow branching model
- All PRs target `develop` branch
- Squash and merge strategy
- Comprehensive linting and testing requirements

## Potential Fix Categories

### 1. TypeScript/Build Issues
- Missing type definitions
- Build configuration problems
- Import/export resolution

### 2. Integration Issues
- Framework-specific integration bugs
- Third-party library compatibility
- SDK initialization problems

### 3. Performance/Tracing Issues
- Span creation/ending problems
- Memory leaks in tracing
- Incorrect span attributes

### 4. Error Handling Issues
- Exception capture failures
- Error boundary problems
- Stack trace processing

## Recommended Investigation Steps

1. **Access the actual GitHub issue** to understand the specific problem
2. **Run the test suite** to identify any failing tests: `yarn test`
3. **Check for linting issues**: `yarn lint` ✅ (COMPLETED - ALL PASS)
4. **Verify build process**: `yarn build:dev`
5. **Look for recent commits** that might have introduced regressions

## Development Workflow

Based on the commit-issue-pr-guidelines.md:
- Commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject> (<github-id>)`
- Issues should be categorized by package
- PRs use "Squash and merge" strategy
- All changes target `develop` branch

## Next Steps Without Issue Details

Since the specific issue cannot be accessed, here are general maintenance tasks that could be performed:

1. **Address high-priority TODOs**:
   ```bash
   # Focus on files with critical TODOs
   - packages/replay-internal/src/replay.ts (file splitting)
   - packages/nestjs/src/integrations/sentry-nest-core-instrumentation.ts (implementations)
   ```

2. **Fix critical FIXMEs**:
   ```bash
   # Address problematic code patterns
   - packages/core/src/carrier.ts (carrier function)
   - packages/core/src/utils/syncpromise.ts (sync promise issue)
   ```

3. **Run comprehensive tests**:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   yarn test:pr
   ```

4. **Check for build issues**:
   ```bash
   yarn build:dev
   ```

## Files That May Need Attention

Based on the analysis, these areas might need investigation:

- `packages/browser/` - Browser SDK with recent tracing fixes
- `packages/vue/` - Vue integration with recent span fixes
- `packages/nextjs/` - Next.js integration with multiple recent fixes
- `packages/core/` - Core functionality with logging improvements
- `packages/replay-internal/` - Multiple TODO items and complexity issues
- `packages/nestjs/` - Incomplete instrumentation implementations

## Conclusion

Without access to the specific issue #16491, I cannot provide a targeted fix. However, the codebase appears to be actively maintained with recent bug fixes and improvements. The most likely areas for issues based on recent changelog entries are:

1. Browser tracing and performance monitoring
2. Framework-specific integrations (Vue, Next.js, React)
3. Error handling and exception capture
4. Build and TypeScript configuration
5. Replay functionality (multiple TODOs found)
6. NestJS instrumentation (incomplete implementations)
